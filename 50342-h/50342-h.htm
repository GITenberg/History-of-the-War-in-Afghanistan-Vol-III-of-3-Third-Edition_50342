Arrival of Lord Ellenborough&mdash;Further Embarrassments.</p>

<p><span class="beg">At</span> this time the Governor-General and his family were
resident at Calcutta. The period of Lord Auckland’s
tenure of the vice-regal office was drawing to a close. He
was awaiting the arrival of his successor. It had seemed
to him, as the heavy periodical rains began slowly to give
place to the cool weather of the early winter, that there
was nothing to overshadow the closing scenes of his
administration, and to vex his spirit with misgivings and
regrets during the monotonous months of the homeward
voyage. The three first weeks of October brought him
only cheering intelligence from the countries beyond the
Indus. The Envoy continued to report, with confidence,
the increasing tranquillity of Afghanistan. The Douranee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
insurrection seemed to have been suppressed, and there
was nothing stirring in the neighbourhood of Caubul to
create anxiety and alarm.</p>

<p>But November set in gloomy and threatening. The
clouds were gathering in the distance. It now seemed
to Lord Auckland that his administration was doomed
to close in storm and convulsion. Intelligence of the
Ghilzye outbreak arrived. It was plain that the passes
were sealed, for there were no tidings from Caubul.
There might be rebellion and disaster at the capital;
our communications were in the hands of the enemy;
and all that was known at Calcutta was that Sale’s
brigade had been fighting its way downwards, and had
lost many men and some officers in skirmishes with the
Ghilzye tribes, which had seemingly been productive of
no important results. There was something in all this
very perplexing and embarrassing. Painful doubts and
apprehensions began to disturb the mind of the Governor-General.
It seemed to be the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>Never was authentic intelligence from Caubul looked
for with so much eager anxiety as throughout the month
of November. When tidings came at last&mdash;only too
faithful in their details of disaster&mdash;they came in a
dubious, unauthoritative shape, and, for a time, were
received with incredulity. At the end of the third week
of November, letters from Meerut, Kurnaul, and other
stations in the upper provinces of Hindostan, announced
that reports had crossed the frontier to the effect that
there had been a general rising at Caubul, that the city
had been fired, and that Sir Alexander Burnes had been
killed. Letters to this effect reached the offices of the
public journals, but no intelligence had been received at
Government House, and a hope was expressed in official
quarters that the stories in circulation were exaggerated
native rumours. But, a day or two afterwards, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
stories were repeated in letters from Mr. George Clerk,
the Governor-General’s agent on the north-western frontier,
and from Captain Mackeson at Peshawur; and the
intelligence came coupled with urgent requisitions for the
despatch of reinforcements to Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Though no authentic tidings had been received from
Caubul, the advices from our political functionaries, on
the intermediate line of country, were of a character not
to be questioned; and Lord Auckland, who a day or two
before had received letters from Sir William Macnaghten,
assuring him that the disturbances were at an end, awoke
to the startling truth that all Caubul was in a blaze, and
the supremacy of the Suddozye Princes and their foreign
supporters threatened by a general outburst of national
indignation. Afghanistan&mdash;serene and prosperous Afghanistan&mdash;with
its popular government and its grateful
people, was in arms against its deliverers. Suddenly the
tranquillity of that doomed country, boasted of in Caubul
and credited in Calcutta, was found to be a great delusion.
Across the whole length and breadth of the land the
history of that gigantic lie was written in characters of
blood. It was now too deplorably manifest that, although
a British army had crossed the Indus and cantoned itself
at Caubul and Candahar, the Afghans were Afghans still;
still a nation of fierce Mahomedans, of hardy warriors,
of independent mountaineers; still a people not to be
dragooned into peace, or awed into submission, by a
scattering of foreign bayonets and the pageantry of a
puppet king.</p>

<p>The blow fell heavily upon Lord Auckland. An amiable
gentleman and a well-intentioned statesman, he had made
for himself many friends; and, perhaps, there was not in
all Calcutta at that time, even amongst the most strenuous
opponents of the policy which had resulted in so much
misery and disgrace, one who did not now grieve for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sufferings of him whose errors had been so severely visited.
Had it fallen at any other time, it would not have been
so acutely felt. But it came upon him at the close of
his reign, when he could do nothing to restore the brilliancy
of his tarnished reputation. He had expected to
embark for England, a happy man and a successful ruler.
He had, as he thought, conquered and tranquillised
Afghanistan. For the former exploit he had been created
an earl; and the latter would have entitled him to the
honour. It is true that he had drained the treasury of
India; but he believed that he was about to hand over
no embryo war to his successor, and that, therefore, the
treasury would soon replenish itself. The prospect was
sufficiently cheering, and he was eager to depart; but the
old year wore to a close, and found Lord Auckland pacing,
with a troubled countenance, the spacious apartments of
Government House&mdash;found him the most luckless of rulers
and the most miserable of men.</p>

<p>Never was statesman so cast down; never was statesman
so perplexed and bewildered. The month of
December was one of painful anxiety; of boding fear;
of embarrassing uncertainty. There was no official
information from Caubul. The private accounts received
from Jellalabad and Peshawur, always brief, often
vague and conflicting, excited the worst apprehensions
without dispelling much of the public ignorance. In
this conjuncture, government were helpless. The Caubul
force, cut off from all support, could by no possibility be
rescued. The utmost vigour and determination&mdash;the
highest wisdom and sagacity&mdash;could avail nothing at
such a time. The scales had fallen from the eyes of the
Governor-General only to show him the utter hopelessness
of the case. In this terrible emergency he seems to have
perceived, for the first time, the madness of posting a
detached force in a foreign country, hundreds of miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from our own frontier, cut off from all support by rugged
mountains and impenetrable defiles. Before a single
brigade could be pushed on to the relief of the beleaguered
force, the whole army might be annihilated.
Clearly Lord Auckland now beheld the inherent viciousness
of the original policy of the war, and, in sorrow and
humiliation, began to bethink himself of the propriety
of abandoning it.</p>

<p>What Lord Auckland now wrote publicly on this
subject is on record; what he wrote privately is known
to a few. That the Governor-General, in this terrible
conjuncture, succumbed to the blow which had fallen
upon him; that his energies did not rise with the occasion,
but that the feebleness of paralysis was conspicuous
in all that he did, has often been asserted and never
confidently denied. But it may be doubted whether his
feelings or his conduct at this time have ever been fairly
judged or clearly understood. The truth is, that he had
originally committed himself to a course of policy which
never had his cordial approbation, and his after-efforts to
uphold which he inwardly regarded as so many attempts
to make the worse appear the better reason. It is plain
that, very soon after the occupation of Caubul had for a
time brought the Afghan campaign to a close, the Governor-General
began to entertain very painful doubts and misgivings;
and that, although he by no means anticipated
the sudden and disastrous fall of the whole edifice he had
raised, he had, long before the close of 1841, repented of
his own infirmity of purpose, in giving way to the counsels of
others; and had begun to doubt whether we had succeeded
in the great object of the war&mdash;the establishment of such
a friendly power in Afghanistan as would secure us against
western aggression. He must have seen, too&mdash;for he was,
in the main, a just and an honest man&mdash;that the policy,
which he had sanctioned, cradled in injustice as it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was continually perpetuating injustice; and he must have
heard the wrongs of the Afghan chiefs and the Afghan
nation eternally crying out to him for redress. Macnaghten
complained that Lord Auckland and Mr. Colvin
were too ready to believe all the stories of the unpopularity
of the government and discontent of the chiefs and the
people, which reached them through obscure channels of
information; though those channels of information were
the local newspapers, whose informants were generally
officers of rank and character. But in spite of the Envoy’s
assurances and denials, Lord Auckland had begun to suspect
that there was something rotten at the core of our Afghan
policy; and something pre-eminently defective in the
administrative conduct of those to whom its working out
had been entrusted. He did not, in the autumn of 1841,
believe that any sudden and overwhelming storm would
cloud the last days of his Indian government; but he had
begun to encourage the belief that he had made a fatal
mistake, and that, sooner or later, the real character of
his Afghan policy would be revealed to the world.</p>

<p>But there was something more than his own doubts
and misgivings to be considered. Lord Auckland knew
that the connexion he had established in Afghanistan was
distasteful in the extreme to the East India Company.
There was good reason for this. The necessity of sustaining
Shah Soojah on the throne of Caubul had drained
the financial resources of the Company to the dregs, and
was entailing upon them liabilities which, if not speedily
retrenched, they might have found it impossible to
discharge. The injustice of the occupation of Afghanistan
was not confined to the people of that country.
A grievous injustice was being inflicted upon the people
of India, the internal improvement of which was
obstructed, to maintain the incapable Suddozye in the
country from which he had been cast out by his offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
people. No man knew this better, or deplored it more
deeply, than Lord Auckland himself. The opinions of the
East India Company upon this subject had been well
known from the very commencement of the war. But
the Court of Directors had no constitutional authority
to suspend the operations which they had not been called
upon to sanction, and only so far as they were represented
in the Secret Committee had they any influence in the
Councils which shaped our measures in Afghanistan.
But no one knew better than Lord Auckland that there
was scarcely one of the twenty-four Directors’ rooms in
the Great Parliament of Leadenhall-street in which the
continued occupation of the country beyond the Indus
was not a subject of perpetual complaint.</p>

<p>And when he turned his thoughts from Leadenhall-street
to Downing-street, it appeared to him that there
were still weightier reasons for the abandonment of our
ill-omened connexion with the countries beyond the Indus.
The Whigs had sent him to India; the Conservatives were
now in office. At the end of August the Melbourne
ministry had resigned; and Peel was now at the head of
the cabinet. It was known that the Conservative party
either were, or made a show of being, radically opposed
to the Afghan policy of the government which they had
displaced. It was natural, therefore, that Lord Auckland,
who was now awaiting the arrival of his successor, should
have shrunk from committing him to any extensive
measures for the recovery of our position in Afghanistan,
which, in all probability, he would not be disposed to
carry out. Whatever amount of energy the old ruler
might now throw into the work before him, it was certain
that he would only be able to commence what he must
leave to his successor to complete. To have handed over
to the new Governor-General the outline of a political
scheme, just sufficiently worked out in its details to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
its abandonment impossible, would have been to embarrass
and hamper him, at the outset of his career, in a manner
that would have perplexed the new ruler in the extreme,
and jeopardised the interests of the empire. He believed
that the policy of the Conservatives was nearly identical
with that of the East India Company, and that they
would eagerly take advantage of the present crisis to
sever our connexion with the countries beyond the Indus,
and to declare the failure of the original scheme propounded
in the Simlah manifesto of 1838.</p>

<p>It is right that Lord Auckland should have ample
credit for suffering these important considerations to
exercise their due influence over his counsels. It is right,
too, that it should be clearly recognised how great was
the moral courage it demanded, either practically to
declare by himself, or to leave to others to declare,
the utter failure of a great political scheme for which he
was responsible to his country, and with which, from
generation to generation, his name will be indissolubly
associated in history. But when all this has been said,
there still remains to be recorded the humiliating fact
that a great crisis suddenly arose, and Lord Auckland
was not equal to it. He had begun to doubt the justice
and expediency of the policy of 1838. And these doubts,
added to his knowledge of the views of the Home
governments, forced upon him the conviction that it had
now become his duty to direct all his efforts to the one
object of withdrawing our beleaguered garrisons in safety
to Hindostan. But he seems, in the bewilderment and
perplexity which followed the stunning blow that had
descended so suddenly upon him, to have forgotten that
there are in the lives of nations, as of men, great and
imminent conjunctures, which not only sanction, but
demand a departure from ordinary rules of conduct and
principles of statesmanship. Such a conjuncture had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
arisen; and, important as were all the considerations recapitulated
above, they should have given place in his
mind to the one paramount desire of demonstrating to all
the nations of the East the invincibility of British arms.
Neither the wishes of the East India Company nor the
opinions of the Conservative government had been declared
in the face of a great disaster. The withdrawal of
the British army from Afghanistan might, and I believe
would, have been a measure of sound policy; but only
if the time and manner of withdrawal had been well
chosen. It could never have been sound policy to withdraw
under the pressure of an overwhelming defeat. To
retire from Afghanistan was one thing; to be driven
out of it was another. A frank avowal of error, calmly
and deliberately enunciated, under no pressure of immediate
danger or insurmountable difficulty, would have
denoted only conscious strength. It would have been
the dignified self-negation of a powerful state daring to
be just to others and true to itself. But to abandon the
country, precipitately and confusedly, under the pressure
of disaster and defeat, would have been a miserable confession
of weakness that might have shaken to its very
foundation the British Empire in the East.</p>

<p>And such a confession of weakness Lord Auckland
was inclined to make. He seemed to reel and stagger
under the blow&mdash;to be paralysed and enfeebled by the
disasters that had overtaken him. His correspondence
at this time betokened such painful prostration, that
some to whom he wrote destroyed, in pity, all traces of
these humiliating revelations. It was vaguely rumoured,
too, how, in bitterness of spirit, he spent long hours
pacing by day the spacious verandahs of Government
House; or, by night, cooling his fevered brow on the
grass-plots in front of it, accompanied by some member
of his household endeared to him by ties of blood. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
curse brooded over him, as it was brooding over Elphinstone
and Macnaghten, darkening his vision, clouding his
judgment, prostrating his energies&mdash;turning everything to
feebleness and folly. New tidings of disaster&mdash;misfortune
treading on the heels of misfortune&mdash;came flooding in
from beyond the Indus; and the chief ruler of the land,
with a great army at his call, thought only of extrication
and retreat; thought of bringing back, instead of pushing
forward, our troops; of abandoning, instead of regaining,
our position. Fascinated, as it were, by the great calamity,
his eyes were rivetted on the little line of country
between Caubul and Peshawur; and he did not see, in his
eagerness to rescue small detachments from danger, and
to escape the immediate recurrence of new disasters in
Afghanistan, that the question now to be solved was one
of far greater scope and significance&mdash;that it was not so
much whether Afghanistan were to be occupied, as
whether India were to be retained. But there were old
and experienced politicians, well acquainted with the
temper of the chiefs and the people of India and the
countries beyond, who believed that any manifestation of
weakness, in this conjuncture, would have endangered the
security of our position in India; and that, therefore,
cost what it might, a blow must be struck for the recovery
of our military supremacy in the countries beyond
the Indus.</p>

<p>But from the very first Lord Auckland began to
despond, and steadfastly set his face against any measures
of military re-establishment. When, on the 25th of
November, he received from Mr. Clerk and Captain
Mackeson intelligence which confirmed the newspaper
accounts received two days before, and read the pressing
requisitions of those officers for the despatch of more
troops to the frontier, he wrote to the Commander-in-Chief,
who was then journeying through the Upper Provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of India: “It is not clear to me how the march
of a brigade can by possibility have any influence upon
the events which it is supposed may be passing at Caubul....
They may be at Jellalabad in February, and
could not march onwards to Caubul before April....
It may be well, perhaps, that two or three regiments
should be assembled at Peshawur.... I wish the requisition
had been made with less trepidation.” Again, on the
1st of December, he wrote to the same officer: “It seems
to me that we are not to think of marching fresh armies
for the re-conquest of that which we are likely to lose....
The difficulty will not be one of fighting and gaining
victories, but of supplies, of movements, and of carriage....
The troops in Afghanistan are sufficiently numerous.
They would but be encumbered by greater numbers,
and reinforcements could not arrive before the
crisis will have passed. If the end is to be disastrous,
they would but increase the extent of the disaster.” On
the following day he again wrote to Sir Jasper Nicolls,
setting forth the views of government, to the effect&mdash;“1st.
That we should not fit out large armaments for
re-conquest&mdash;such an enterprise would be beyond our
means. 2nd. That even for succours the season is
unfavourable and impracticable, and months must pass
before it could be attempted. 3rdly. That if aid can be
given, the officer in command should not be prohibited
from seizing the opportunity of affording it. I fear,”
added the Governor-General in this letter, “that safety
to the force at Caubul can only come from itself.” On
the 5th he wrote to the same correspondent, that “we
should stand fast and gather strength at Peshawur”&mdash;on
the Sutlej, and on the Indus. “Our power,” he said, “of
giving succour is extremely limited, and if it come at all,
it can only come tardily.... We must look on an
advance from Jellalabad for some months as utterly out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the question. An advance even to Jellalabad could
only be to give security to Sale, and with the aid of the
Sikhs, one brigade, with artillery, should be sufficient.
If all should be lost at Caubul we will not encounter new
hazards for re-conquest.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On the 9th of December he
wrote, still more emphatically: “The present state of
affairs, whether its issue be fortunate or disastrous, is
more likely to lead within a few months to the withdrawal
of troops to our frontiers than to the employment
of larger means beyond it.” A week afterwards he
wrote, still to the Commander-in-Chief: “We must know
more before we can decide anything, or lay down any
large scheme of measures.... There are already more
regiments beyond the frontier than we can feed or easily
pay.... You know I would not be too profuse in
sending strength forward.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> What Lord Auckland’s
intentions were at this time may be gathered from these
letters. He thought only of saving all that could be
saved; and of escaping out of Afghanistan with the least
possible delay.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief to whom these letters were
addressed was, as has been said, at this time on his way
through the Upper Provinces of India. Sir Jasper Nicolls
had been consistently opposed to the entire scheme of
Afghan invasion, and had with rare prescience and sagacity
foretold the disastrous downfall of a policy based upon a
foundation of such complicated error. He had spent his
life in the camp; but his public minutes, as well as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
private letters and journals, written throughout the years
1840-41, indicate a larger amount of political sagacity
than we find displayed in the expressed opinions of his
official contemporaries, to whom statesmanship was the
profession and practice of their lives. He had all along
protested against the withdrawal of our troops from their
legitimate uses in the British Provinces, and urged that it
was necessary either so to increase the Indian army as to
enable the government to keep up an adequate force in
Afghanistan without weakening the defences of Hindostan,
or to withdraw the British troops altogether from the
countries beyond the Indus. It was now his opinion&mdash;an
opinion in which the Governor-General participated&mdash;that,
inasmuch as the Indian army, largely indented upon as it
was for service beyond the frontier, was greatly below the
right athletic strength, it would be impossible to pour
strong reinforcements into Afghanistan without weakening
the British Provinces in such a manner as to provoke both
external aggression and internal revolt.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But supineness,
in such a conjuncture, was more likely to have provoked
aggression than activity, although the latter might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
denuded India of some of its best troops. Macnaghten
told Runjeet Singh, in the summer of 1838, that the
military resources of the British-Indian Government were
such that 200,000 soldiers might at any time be brought
into the field to resist simultaneous aggression from all
the four sides of India; and although this may have
been only an approximation to the sober truth, it is
certain that, if the dispatch of a couple of brigades to
Jellalabad, and subsequently to Caubul, would have
jeopardised the security of India, the military resources of
the government must have been in a very depressed state.
When Sir Jasper Nicolls, meeting the flood of intelligence
from beyond the Indus, as he advanced through the
Upper Provinces of India, recorded, in letters to the
Governor-General, his belief that it would be unwise to
prosecute another war in support of the Suddozye provinces,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
he expressed only the sound opinion of a sagacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
politician. But he seems to have forgotten that there
was something more than the restoration of the Suddozye
dynasty to be accomplished&mdash;there was the restoration of
the military supremacy of Great Britain in Central Asia
to be achieved; and whatever may have been the scruples
of the statesman, in such a crisis as this, the soldier ought
not to have hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>But whilst such were the opinions of the Governor-General
and the Commander-in-Chief, there were other
functionaries nearer to the scene of action at the time,
whose feelings prompted, and whose judgment dictated, a
more energetic course of procedure. Among these were
Mr. Robertson, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western
Provinces, and Mr. George Clerk, the Governor-General’s
Agent on the North-Western Frontier. Both of
these able and experienced officers recognised the paramount
necessity of pushing on troops to Peshawur with
the utmost possible despatch. On the latter devolved, in
the first instance, the responsibility of moving forward the
regiments which were in readiness to proceed for the
periodical relief of the troops in Afghanistan,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as well as a
regiment which was in orders for Sindh.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> On the 16th of
November, he addressed letters to Colonel Wild, the
commanding officer at Ferozepore, and Colonel Rich, who
commanded at Loodhianah, urging them to send on to
Peshawur, as speedily as possible, the regiments named in
the margin.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In compliance with these requisitions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
64th Regiment crossed the Sutlej on the 18th of November
and the 60th on the 20th of November. The 53rd,
which was accompanied by the 30th Regiment,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> crossed
the river on the 26th.</p>

<p>Having expedited the movement of these regiments,
Mr. Clerk began to make preparations for the despatch of
another brigade to Peshawur, and addressed General Boyd,
who at that time commanded the Sirhind division, on the
subject. At the same time, he addressed urgent letters
to the Court of Lahore, apprising them of the intended
march of the regiments through the Punjaub&mdash;calling on
them to supply boats for the passage of the river&mdash;and
suggesting to the Maharajah that he should “cause the
immediate march of his son, Koonwur Pertab Singh, on
Peshawur, with 5000 of their best troops from the neighbouring
district of Chuck Huzara.” Captain Mackeson
had before applied to the Sikh authorities at Peshawur for
6000 men to march on Jellalabad; but had been told by
General Avitabile that he had few troops at Peshawur,
and that he required them all for the protection of the
Sikh territory.</p>

<p>Lord Auckland, however, was strongly of opinion that
the second brigade, which was to comprise her Majesty’s
9th Foot, the 10th Light (Native) Cavalry, and a troop
of Horse Artillery, ought not to be moved forward.
“We do not now,” wrote the Governor-General in
Council, on the 3rd of December, “desire to send a
second brigade in advance, for we do not conceive it to
be called for, for the objects of support and assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which we contemplate; and we think it inexpedient to
despatch any greater number of troops than be absolutely
necessary from our own provinces.” And two days
afterwards he wrote privately to the Commander-in-Chief:
“I heartily hope that the second brigade may not have
been sent.” He could not, he added, “see of what
service it could be at present. One brigade, with the
artillery which you purpose sending, should be sufficient
to force the Khybur pass; and ten brigades could not,
at this season of the year, force the passes to Caubul.”</p>

<p>But the “one brigade with artillery” never went to
Peshawur. The Native Infantry crossed the Punjaub
under the command of Brigadier Wild. Some artillerymen
went with them;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but there was no Artillery, for
there were no guns. It was expected, however, that the
Sikhs would supply the ordnance which the British had
left out of the account. “You have not at present any
guns,” wrote the Head-Quarters’ Staff to Brigadier Wild,
“but you have artillerymen, sappers and miners, and
officers of both corps. His Excellency is not aware of any
difficulty likely to prevent your being accommodated by
the Sikh Governor-General, Avitabile, with four or six
pieces; and you will solicit such aid, when necessary,
through Captain Mackeson.” But when Brigadier Wild
reached Peshawur, a day or two before the close of the
year, he found that difficulties had arisen to prevent the
preparation of the expected Sikh guns for service. The
artillerymen were disinclined to hand them over to the
British; and though great doubts were entertained as to
whether they were in reality worth anything, it was hard
to compass a loan of the suspected pieces. And so
Brigadier Wild, urged as he was from all quarters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
push on to Jellalabad, with the provisions, treasure, and
ammunition he was to escort thither, sate down quietly at
Peshawur, whilst Captains Mackeson and Lawrence were
endeavouring to overcome the coyness of the Sikh
artillerymen; and began to apprehend that his march
would be delayed until some field-pieces were sent to him
from India.</p>

<p>His suspense, however, was of not very long duration.
On the 3rd of January, four rickety guns were handed
over to the British officers; but not without a show of
resistance on the part of the Sikh artillerymen. On the
following day, one of the limbers went to pieces under
trial; and then it had to be replaced. Other difficulties,
too, met Wild at Peshawur. His camel-men were playing
the old game of desertion. The Afreedi Maliks had not
yet been bribed into submission by Mackeson; and the
loyalty of our Sikh allies was so doubtful, that they were
just as likely, on Wild’s brigade entering the Khybur, to
attack him in rear as to keep the pass open for him. All
these elements of delay were greatly to be lamented.
There was a forward feeling among the Sepoys which
might have been checked. They were eager to advance
when they reached Peshawur; and their enthusiasm was
little likely to be increased by days of inactivity in a
sickly camp, exposed to the contaminating influences of
the Sikh soldiery, who, always dreading the deep passes
of the Khybur, now purposely exaggerated its terrors,
and endeavoured by other means to raise the fears, to
excite the prejudices of the Sepoys, and to shake their
fidelity to the government which they served.</p>

<p>In the mean while active preparations for the despatch
of further reinforcements to Peshawur were going on in
the North-Western Provinces of India. Lord Auckland
could not readily bring himself to recognise the expediency
of sending forward a second brigade: but Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Clerk had taken the initiative, and the Governor-General
was unwilling to disturb any arrangements which already
were being brought into effect. The 9th Foot had been
ordered to hold itself in readiness, and another regiment,
the 26th Native Infantry, was to be sent with it, accompanied
by some irregular horse, and a scanty supply of
artillery.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The Commander-in-Chief was “not prepared”
for this demand, and the Governor-General in Council
thought it “undesirable” to send more troops in advance.
But it was obvious to the authorities on the north-western
frontier that the state of affairs in Afghanistan
was becoming every day more critical; and that it was
expedient to concentrate the utmost available strength on
the frontier of Afghanistan. Towards the end of the
year, the Governor-General having expressed a strong
opinion regarding the necessity of attaching some regular
horse to the brigade, the 10th Cavalry were ordered to
proceed under Brigadier M’Caskill (of the 9th Foot), who,
as senior officer, took command of the force; and on the
4th of January the brigade, consisting of 3034 fighting
men, crossed the Sutlej on its way to Peshawur.</p>

<p>To command the body of troops now assembling for
service beyond the frontier, it became necessary to select
an officer of good military repute and unquestionable
energy and activity, combined with a cool judgment and
a sound discretion. Sir Jasper Nicolls had, in the month
of November, when the despatch of a Queen’s regiment
to Peshawur was first contemplated, pointed to Sir
Edmund Williams, as a general officer well fitted for
such command. But to the Governor-General it appeared
expedient to place an experienced officer of the Company’s
service at the head of affairs, and Sir Edmund Williams
was a general of the royal army, who had served but two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
years in India at the time of the Caubul outbreak, and
who knew as little of the Sepoy army as he did of the
politics of Afghanistan. Lord Auckland had made his
election. In Major-General Lumley, the adjutant-general
of the army, he thought that he saw all the qualifications
which it behoved the commander of such an army to
possess. But there was one thing that Lumley wanted;
he wanted physical health and strength. When the
Governor-General sent up the nomination to head-quarters,
the Commander-in-Chief at once replied that
Lumley could not take the command; and again Nicolls
recommended the appointment of Sir Edmund Williams.
Indeed, he had determined on sending for that officer to
his camp, and arming him at once with instructions; but
subsequent letters from Calcutta made it only too plain
that the appointment would be extremely distasteful to
the Supreme Government; and so the intention was
abandoned. General Lumley was at head-quarters.
The Commander-in-Chief sent for him to his tent,
placed in his hand a letter his Excellency had just received
from the Governor-General relative to Lumley’s
employment beyond the frontier, and called upon him
for his final decision. The General was willing to cross
the Indus; but, doubtful of his physical ability to undertake
so onerous a duty, placed the decision of the question
in the hands of his medical advisers, who at once
declared that he was totally unequal to meet “the required
exertion and exposure” demanded by such a
campaign.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief at once determined to nominate
another Company’s officer to the command of the troops
proceeding to Peshawur. His choice then fell upon
General George Pollock, who commanded the garrison
of Agra.&mdash;Receiving his military education at the Woolwich
Academy, this officer had entered the Indian army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
as a lieutenant of artillery in the year 1803, when Lake
and Wellesley were in the field, and all India was watching,
with eager expectancy, the movements of the grand armies
which, by victory after victory, were breaking down the
power of the Mahrattas. At the storm and capture of
Dieg, in 1803, young Pollock was present; and in 1805,
during the gallant but unsuccessful attempts of the
British army to carry Bhurtpore by assault, he was busy
in the trenches. At the close of the same year he was
selected by Lord Lake to command the artillery with the
detachment under Colonel Ball, sent in pursuit of Holkar.
From this time he held different regimental staff appointments
up to the year 1817, when, in command of the
artillery with General Wood’s force, he took part in the
stirring scenes of the Nepaul war. In 1818 he was appointed
Brigade-Major; and subsequently, on the creation
of that appointment, held the Assistant-Adjutant-Generalship
of Artillery up to the year 1824, when, having
attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he volunteered
to join the army which was assembling for the prosecution
of the Burmese war, and was nominated by Sir Edward
Paget to command the Bengal Artillery attached to the
force under Sir Archibald Campbell, proceeding to Rangoon.
For his services during the war he received the
decoration of the Companionship of the Bath. From this
time, except during an interval of some three years spent
in England for the recovery of his health, he held different
regimental and brigade commands, until, at the close of
1841, being then Major-General, in command of the
garrison of Agra, he was selected by Sir Jasper Nicolls to
take command of the troops proceeding to Peshawur, and
ordered at once to proceed to the frontier by dawk.</p>

<p>The appointment of General Pollock gave the greatest
satisfaction to the Supreme Government, and not even a
murmur of disapprobation arose from the general body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the army. The nomination of this old and distinguished
Company’s officer was believed to be free from the corruption
of aristocratic influence and the taint of personal
favouritism. It was felt, that in this case at least, the
selection had been made solely on the ground of individual
merit. And the merit which was thus rewarded was of
the most modest and unostentatious character. There
was not, perhaps, in the whole Indian army a man of
more unassuming manners and a more retiring disposition:
there was not one less likely to have sought notoriety for
its own sake, or to have put himself forward in an effort
to obtain it. Pollock’s merits did not lie upon the surface.
He was not what is called a “dashing officer;” he
shrunk from anything like personal display, and never
appealed to the vulgar weaknesses of an unreflecting
community. But beneath a most unassuming exterior
there lay a fund of good sense, of innate sagacity, of quiet
firmness and collectedness. He was equable and temperate.
He was thoroughly conscientious. If he was
looked upon by the Indian Government as a <i>safe</i> man, it
was not merely because he always exercised a calm and
dispassionate judgment, but because he was actuated in
all that he did by the purest motives, and sustained by
the highest principles. He was essentially an honest man.
There was a directness of purpose about him which won
the confidence of all with whom he was associated. They
saw that his one paramount desire was a desire to do his
duty to his country by consulting, in every way, the welfare
and the honour of the troops under his command;
and they knew that they would never be sacrificed, either
on the one hand by the rash ambition, or on the other by
the feebleness and indecision, of their leader. The force
now to be despatched to the frontier of Afghanistan
required the superintendence and control of an officer
equally cool and firm, temperate and decided; and, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the whole range of the Indian army, the Government
could not have found one in whom these qualities
were more eminently combined than in the character of
General Pollock.</p>

<p>Hastening to place himself at the head of his men,
Pollock left Agra, and proceeded by dawk to the frontier.
The second brigade was then making its way through the
Punjaub, under General M’Caskill; and the authorities in
the North-Western Provinces were exerting themselves to
push on further reinforcements to Peshawur.</p>

<p>On the 22d of January, the Commander-in-Chief and
Mr. George Clerk met at Thanesur, some two marches
distant from Kurnaul. They had received the melancholy
tidings of the destruction of the Caubul force; and
they took counsel together regarding the measures to be
pursued in consequence of this gigantic calamity. Very
different were the views of these two functionaries. To
Sir Jasper Nicolls it appeared that the destruction of the
Caubul force afforded no reason for the advance of further
reinforcements; but rather seemed to indicate the expediency
of a retrograde movement on the part of all the
remaining troops beyond the Indus. It was his opinion&mdash;an
opinion to some extent shared by the Supreme Government&mdash;that
the retention of Jellalabad being no longer
necessary to support the Caubul army, or to assist its
retreat, the withdrawal of the garrison to Peshawur had
become primarily expedient; and that, as the re-conquest
and re-occupation of Afghanistan were not under any
circumstances to be recommended, it was desirable that,
after the safety of Sale’s brigade had been secured, the
whole force should return to Hindostan. But Mr. Clerk
was all for a forward movement. He argued that the
safety and the honour of the British nation demanded
that we should hold our own at Jellalabad, until the
garrison, reinforced by fresh troops from the provinces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
India, could march upon Caubul, in conjunction with the
Candahar force moving from the westward, chastise the
enemy on the theatre of their recent successes, and then
withdraw altogether from Afghanistan “with dignity and
undiminished honour.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was gall and wormwood to
George Clerk to think for a moment of leaving the
Afghans, flushed with success, to revel in the humiliation
of the British Government, and to boast of the destruction
of a British army. Emphatically he dwelt on the disgrace
of inactivity in such a crisis; and emphatically he dwelt
upon the danger. Coolly and quietly, as one whose ordinary
serenity was not to be disturbed by any accidental
convulsions, Sir Jasper Nicolls set forth in reply that the
return of so many regiments to the provinces, and the
vast reduction of expenditure that would attend it, would
place the government in such a position of strength as
would enable it summarily to chastise any neighbouring
state that might presume upon our recent misfortunes to
show a hostile front against us. The demand for more
troops he would have resisted altogether; but the urgency
of George Clerk was not to be withstood, and two more
regiments&mdash;the 6th and 55th Native Infantry&mdash;were
ordered to hold themselves in readiness to proceed to
Peshawur. But when Clerk asked for a detachment of
British dragoons, Nicolls peremptorily resisted the demand,
and referred the question to the Supreme Government.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Before the reference reached Calcutta, the Supreme Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
had received intelligence of the massacre of Elphinstone’s
army; and wrote back to the Commander-in-Chief
that it was essentially necessary that a commanding force
should assemble at Peshawur&mdash;that it was particularly
important that the force should be effective in cavalry
and artillery, and that at all events two squadrons of
European dragoons should be pushed on to Peshawur.
The 1st Regiment of Native Cavalry and a troop of
Horse-Artillery were subsequently added to the third
brigade.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile increasing care and anxiety were
brooding over Government House. Gloomily the new
year dawned upon its inmates. And there was not in
that great palaced city, or in any one of the smaller
stations and cantonments of India, an Englishman whose
heart did not beat, and whose hand did not tremble with
anxiety, for the fate of the Caubul force, when he opened
the letters or papers which brought him intelligence from
beyond the frontier. No one who dwelt in any part of
India during the early months of 1842, will ever forget
the anxious faces and thick voices with which tidings
were sought; questions and opinions interchanged;
hopes and fears expressed; rumours sifted; probabilities
weighed; and how, as the tragedy deepened in solemn
interest, even the most timid and desponding felt that
the ascertained reality far exceeded in misery and horror
all that their excited imaginations had darkly foretold.
There was a weight in the social atmosphere, as of dense
superincumbent thunder-clouds. The festivities of the
cold season were arrested; gaiety and hospitality were
not. There were few families in the country which did
not sicken with apprehension for the fate of some beloved
relative or friend, whilst unconnected men, in whom the
national overlaid the personal feeling, in this conjuncture,
sighed over the tarnished reputation of their country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
burned to avenge the murder of their countrymen and
the insults that had been heaped upon the nation.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant to record that, in this great and
melancholy crisis, the public looked up with confidence
and assurance to the statesman upon whom was now
thrown the responsibility of extricating from the quickset
of danger and difficulty that environed them, the imperilled
affairs of the British Indian Empire. But history
can give currency to no such fiction. As time advanced
it became more and more painfully evident that Lord
Auckland was reeling and staggering beneath the blow
that had descended upon him. He appeared to be
unable to decide upon any consistent plan of action.
At one time he seems to have contemplated the withdrawal
of the Jellalabad garrison to Peshawur, leaving it
to fight its own way through the pass; at another, he
seems to have been fully impressed with the necessity of
retaining the former post, if only for the protection of the
Caubul force; then he talked, as I have shown, of concentrating
a large army at Peshawur, and almost immediately
afterwards began to think that it would be more
expedient to have our advanced post at Ferozepore.
There was only one point on which he seems clearly to
have made up his mind. He was resolute not to recommend
a forward movement for the re-occupation of Caubul.
He believed that any such attempt would be attended with
disaster and disgrace; and he considered that it became
him, on the eve of departure, as he was, not to embarrass
his successor by inextricably pledging the Government to
measures which the new Viceroy might consider “rash,
impolitic, and ruinous.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of January, the worst fears of the Government
were confirmed. An express arrived from Mr.
Clerk, setting forth, on the authority of letters received
from Macgregor at Jellalabad, that the Caubul force had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
been utterly destroyed. Some vague rumours of this
crowning disaster had obtained currency in Calcutta a
day or two before; and now the terrible apprehensions
of the public were found to have been only the presages
of actual truth. The immediate effect of this astounding
intelligence upon the conduct of Government was to
rouse the Governor-General into something like a temporary
demonstration of vigour. He issued a proclamation
declaring that he considered the calamity that had
overtaken the British arms only “as a new occasion for
displaying the stability and vigour of the British power,
and the admirable spirit and valour of the British-Indian
army.” But it was little more than a spasm of
energy. The ink with which this notification was written
was hardly dry, before the Governor-General in
Council wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, that Jellalabad
was not a place which he desired to be kept at all
hazards, and after succour should have been given to Sir
R. Sale’s brigade then, and relief should have been given
to parties arriving from Caubul, the Governor-General in
Council would wish General Pollock, rather than run
extreme risks in that position, to arrange for the withdrawal
of it, and the assembling of his force at or near
Peshawur.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>As time advanced, the retrograde tendencies of Lord
Auckland’s determination became more and more apparent.
On the 10th of February, the Governor-General
in Council wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, instructing
him to inform General Pollock that, “as the main
inducement for the maintenance of a post at Jellalabad&mdash;namely,
that of being a point of support to any of our
troops escaping from Caubul&mdash;having now unhappily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
passed away, it is the object of the Government that he
should, unless any unforeseen contingency should give a
decidedly favourable turn to affairs, confine himself to
measures for withdrawing the Jellalabad garrison in
safety to Peshawur, and there for the present, holding
together all the troops under his orders in a secure
position, removed from collision with the Sikh forces or
subjects.” And on the same day, Mr. Maddock, the
chief secretary, under instructions from the Supreme
Government, wrote to Mr. Clerk that “it would be
highly desirable that when Jellalabad was no longer
held by us, our detachments, which have been moved
forward in support to meet a present emergency, should
be brought gradually back to their cantonments, in
order that any ulterior operations that may be determined
upon for another advance beyond the Indus (and
that towards the Khybur and Jellalabad is probably not
the one to which preference would be given) may be
undertaken after full preparation, with a complete equipment,
and in fresh and well-organised strength.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Lord Auckland had been startled by the astounding
intelligence of the massacre of Elphinstone’s army into
an ebullition of energy by no means in accordance with
the previous tenor of the measures which he had
initiated, and not more in accordance with those which
were about to emanate from him. After the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
paroxysm of horror and indignation was over, he began
again to settle down quietly in the conviction that it
was best to do as little as possible on the other side of
the Indus, lest worse misfortunes should descend upon
us, and the attempt to recover our lost reputation
should result only in further disgrace.</p>

<p>By this time the doubts of those who had speculated
on the subject of the succession to the Governor-Generalship
had been set at rest by the arrival of the Overland
Mail. The despatches received in December announced
that the choice of the home ministry had fallen upon one
of their own body; and that the East India Company
had ratified the choice. Lord Ellenborough, who had
before filled and was now filling the office of President
of the Board of Control, had been appointed Viceroy of
India. The question of the succession had been canvassed
with more than common eagerness, and its solution looked
forward to with unusual interest. When the intelligence
at last arrived it took the majority by surprise. The
probability of the appointment of Lord Ellenborough had
not been entertained. Sir James Graham, Lord Heytesbury,
Lord Lichfield&mdash;nay, even Lord Lyndhurst, had
been named; but speculation had not busied itself with
the name of Lord Ellenborough.</p>

<p>But the intelligence, though unexpected, was not
unwelcome. It was, indeed, received with universal
satisfaction. The Press, with one accord, spoke of the
appointment with approbation; and the public confirmed
the verdict of the Press. All parties were alike sanguine&mdash;all
prepared to look for good in the new Governor-General.
There is not a community on the face of the
earth less influenced by the spirit of faction, than the
community of British India. To support, or to oppose
the measures of a Governor, simply because he is a Whig
or a Tory, is an excess of active prejudice wholly unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in India. There are no political parties, and there is no
party Press to play out such a game as this. Public men
are judged, not by what they belong to, but by what
belongs to them; and thus was Lord Ellenborough judged.
Whig and Tory alike hailed the appointment: for the new
Governor-General was held in some degree of estimation
as one who had made India his study, and cherished a
laudable interest in its welfare. He was believed to be
possessed of more than average talent; to be assiduous
in his attention to business; and rather an able man of
detail than a statesman of very brilliant promise. They,
who thought most about the matter, anticipated that he
would make a good, steady, peace-governor; that he
would apply himself devotedly to the task of improving
the internal administration of the country; and by a
steady and consistent course of policy soon disengage the
country from the pressure of financial embarrassment
which had long sate so heavily upon it. They knew little
and cared less about the personal eccentricities which in
England had been imputed to him. Neither the Press
nor the Public concerned itself about these manifestations
of the outer man. They thought of the newly appointed
Governor-General as an able and laborious man of business,
with a more than common knowledge of the history of
India and the details of its administration. They knew
that not only had his occupancy, for many years, of the
chief seat at the India Board, rendered him familiar with
the workings of the Indian Government; but that, on
every occasion, when Indian affairs had been discussed in
the House of Lords, in power or out of power, he had
taken a prominent part in the debates. In 1833, when
the provisions of the existing charter were under the
consideration of Parliament, he had distinguished himself
as one of the ablest, but most moderate opponents of
certain of its clauses, contending in favour of the diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the powers of the Indian Governors by the
imposition of the wholesome control of Council; and
earnestly protesting against the perilous evil of leaving
too much to the unbridled passions or the erratic caprice
of a single man. In later days, he had denounced the
war in Afghanistan, in fitting terms of severe censure;
and all things combined to render the Indian public
hopeful of a good, steady, peaceful administration.
Conservative exchanged congratulations with Liberal on
the cheering prospects, now opening out before them,
of many years of peaceful government and financial
prosperity. Lord Ellenborough was believed to be a
moderate statesman&mdash;somewhat too liberal for the Tories
of the ministerial camp, but not for the modified conservatism
of India, where every man is more or less a
Reformer; and as a moderate statesman all men were
prepared to welcome him.</p>

<p>In October, 1841, he was elected to fill the office of
Governor-General; and on the 4th of the following
month, he attended the usual complimentary dinner,
given, on such occasions, by the Court of Directors.
The report of that dinner, which reached India simultaneously
with the intelligence of Lord Ellenborough’s
appointment, had a natural tendency to increase the
confidence, engendered by his Lordship’s previous history,
in the judgment and moderation of the new Governor-General.
On returning thanks, after his health had
been drunk, Lord Ellenborough, at that farewell dinner,
on the 4th of November, 1841, made a most emphatic
declaration of his intentions to govern India upon
peace principles; he abjured all thoughts of a warlike,
aggressive policy; and declared his settled determination,
on assuming the reins of government, to direct all
the energies of his mind towards the due cultivation
of the arts of peace; to emulate the magnificent benevolence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the Mahomedan conquerors; to elevate and
improve the condition of the generous and mighty people
of India. He spoke, it is true, in ignorance of the
terrible disasters which soon afterwards cast a pall over
the land; but there was in the speech so clear and
explicit an exposition of what were supposed to be fixed
principles, that the Public could not but rejoice over a
declaration which promised so much eventual benefit to
the people of the soil. They looked forward to the
advent of the new Governor-General as to that of a man
who, at the earliest possible moment consistent with the
dignity of our position, would sever at a blow our ill-fated
connexion with Afghanistan, and devote the remaining
years of his administration to the practical development
of those high principles which he had so enthusiastically
professed.</p>

<p>It is probable that the nomination of Lord Ellenborough
increased the embarrassments of Lord Auckland,
and strengthened him in his resolution to suspend, as
far as possible, all retributive measures until the arrival
of his successor. There was no public man in England
whose opinions, regarding the justice and policy of the
war in Afghanistan, had been more emphatically expressed
than those of the Governor-General elect. Lord
Auckland knew that he was to be succeeded by a statesman
who had pronounced the war to be a blunder and a
crime; and there was a strong conviction within him that
Lord Ellenborough would be eager to withdraw every
British soldier from Afghanistan, and to sever at once
a connexion which had been attended with so much
disaster and disgrace. As the responsible author of the
war, this demanded from him no small amount of moral
courage. It was, indeed, to court a reversal of the policy
which he had originated, and to place the power of a
sweeping practical condemnation in the hands of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
political rival. If the conduct of Lord Auckland, at
this time, were wanting in energy and decision, it was
by no means wanting in honesty. He saw that he had
committed a blunder of enormous magnitude, and he left
it to a statesman of a rival party, and an opposite faith,
to pronounce sentence upon it.</p>

<p>But it was not permitted to Lord Auckland so to
suspend the progress of events, as to enable him to hand
over to his successor only the chart of a virgin campaign,
to be accepted or rejected by the new ruler, as might
seem fit to him, on taking up the reins of office. It was
decreed that his administration should set amidst the
clouds of continued disaster. There was nothing but
failure to be written down in the concluding chapter
of his unfortunate reign. Scarcely had he risen up
from the prostration that followed the first stunning
effects of the dire intelligence of the massacre in the
Caubul passes, when there came from Peshawur tidings
that the brigade under Colonel Wild had been disastrously
beaten in the Khybur Pass. The first scene of the new,
like the last of the old campaign, was a great calamity;
and Lord Auckland, now more than ever dispirited and
dejected, earnestly longed for the day when it would
be vouchsafed to him to close his portfolio, and to turn
his back for ever upon a country where sloughs of
difficulty and thickets of danger seemed to cover the
whole expanse.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[January-April: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Halt at Peshawur&mdash;Position of Brigadier Wild&mdash;His Difficulties&mdash;Conduct
of the Sikhs&mdash;Attempt on Ali-Musjid&mdash;Failure of the
Brigade&mdash;Arrival of General Pollock&mdash;State of the Force&mdash;Affairs
at Jellalabad&mdash;Correspondence between Sale and Pollock.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> position of Brigadier Wild at Peshawur was
not one to infuse into a military commander any very
overflowing feelings of hope and exultation. He was
called upon to encounter formidable difficulties with
slender means. Everything, indeed, was against him.
He had four Native infantry regiments, containing a
large number of young soldiers. They had been exposed
for some time to the deteriorating contact of the
mutinous Sikh soldiery, who had done their best to
fill our Sepoys with that horror of the Khybur to
which they had always abandoned themselves. The
only cavalry with the brigade was a troop of irregular
horse. The only guns were four pieces of Sikh artillery,
which had a bad habit of knocking their carriages
to pieces whenever they were fired. There was a
scarcity of ammunition. Carriage was beginning to fail
altogether. It was believed that the camels had been
hired at Ferozepore to proceed as far as Jellalabad; but
now the owners declared that they had entered into no
such contract, and resolutely refused to proceed further
than Peshawur. The most dispiriting intelligence was
coming in from Afghanistan. Every day seemed to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
some darker tints to the picture of our discomfiture, and
to bring out in more prominent colours the triumphant
success of the Afghans. Sale and Macgregor were
writing from Jellalabad to urge the immediate advance
of the brigade; and General Avitabile was endeavouring,
on the other hand, to persuade the Brigadier that
it would be dangerous to enter the pass with the force
which he then commanded.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The co-operation of the
Sikh soldiery, in spite of Avitabile’s exertions, seemed
every day to become a fainter probability. They peremptorily
refused at one time to proceed to Jumrood, from
which point it was intended that the operations should
commence, and declared that they would return to Lahore.
Then threatening to kill Avitabile himself if he interfered
with them, they intercepted one of the guns
which were moving forward for our use, and carried it back
to their lines. It was obvious, indeed, that they desired
our discomfiture more than our success; and, in spite of
the declared wishes of their Sovereign, whose sincerity
at this time is not to be questioned,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the efforts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the local governor, did everything that they could do, to
render the latter the more probable contingency of the
two. The negotiations with the Afreedi chiefs were not
going on prosperously, and there was every prospect of
heavy opposition in the pass. Under such circumstances,
Brigadier Wild could only write that he was prepared
to move forward whenever it was expedient to do so,
but that he could not answer for the consequences of
a precipitate advance.</p>

<p>It was not, however, permitted him to remain long
in doubt and inactivity. The fortress of Ali-Musjid lies
some five miles within the entrance of the Khybur
Pass, and about twenty-five from Peshawur. It consists
of two small forts, connected by a wall of little
strength, and stands upon the summit of an isolated
oblong rock, commanded on the southern and western
sides by two lofty hills. It has always been regarded
as the key to the Khybur Pass; and now that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lying between the two positions of Sale and Wild, it was
of immense importance that it should be held by British
troops or their allies. It had recently been garrisoned
by a small detachment of a local corps, composed of men
of the Eusofzye tribe&mdash;some of whom, under Mr. Mackeson,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
had been true to their employers, and gallantly
commanded, had gallantly resisted the attacks of the
Afreedi clan. But there was now every chance of its
falling into the hands of the enemy. Nothing appeared
to be of so much primary importance as the occupation of
this post. It was resolved, therefore, that one-half of the
brigade should be pushed forward, in the first instance
to seize and garrison Ali-Musjid.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the 15th of January, Colonel Moseley
with the 53rd and 64th Sepoy regiments, prepared to
commence the march to Ali-Musjid. They started under
cover of the night, and reached their destination soon
after daybreak. They met with little opposition on the
way; but soon after their arrival under the rock of Ali-Musjid,
Captain Mackeson, who had accompanied the
force, discovered to his dismay that, instead of 350
supply-bullocks, for the advance of which he had made
suitable arrangements, only fifty or sixty now were
straggling in with the rear-guard. The remainder, by
some mismanagement or miscomprehension of orders,
had been left behind. Thus had the two regiments
which, had the cattle come on to Ali-Musjid, might
have held that place in security for a month, shut themselves
up in an isolated fortress without provisions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the plans which had been so anxiously debated by our
political officers at Peshawur, utterly frustrated by an
oversight of the most disastrous character, of which it
is difficult to determine on whom we are to fix the
blame.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The only hope of extrication from this dilemma, without
disaster and discredit, lay in the advance of the
two other regiments, with the Sikh guns and the Sikh
auxiliaries. But day after day passed, and Mackeson
and Moseley gained no certain intelligence of the movements
of their comrades. They were more than once
under arms to support the coming reinforcements; but
the reinforcements never appeared in sight. Wild, with
the two regiments, had made an effort to throw supplies
into Ali-Musjid, but had been disastrously beaten in the
attempt.</p>

<p>Wild was to have moved forward with the Sikh
auxiliaries on the morning of the 19th of January, but
on the preceding evening, at eleven o’clock, the Sikh
troops mutinied to a man, and refused to enter the pass.
They were at this time with the British at Jumrood.
But when Wild prepared to advance, they turned their
faces in an opposite direction, and marched back upon
Peshawur.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> General Avitabile sent orders to his officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to close the city gates against the mutinous regiments;
and then shut himself up in the fort.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock, the 30th and 60th regiments with the
Sikh guns commenced their march to Ali-Musjid. The
enemy appeared at the entrance of the pass and met the
advancing column with a fire from their jezails. The
Sepoys at the head of the column wavered, stood still,
crowded upon each other, fired anywhere, aimless and
without effect. The officers moved forward, but the
regiments did not follow them. In vain the Brigadier
and his staff called upon them to advance; they only
huddled together in confusion and dismay. The Sikh
guns, when brought into action, broke down one after
the other; and the Sepoys lost all heart. Lawrence
exerted himself manfully to save the guns; but he could
not induce the men to make an effort to carry them off;
and one of the heavy pieces was finally abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
There was nothing to be done after this but to fall back.
The Brigadier himself was wounded in the face; several
of our officers were injured; one killed. The loss among
the Sepoys was severe. It was plain that they would not
advance; so the column fell back on Jumrood, and Ali-Musjid
was not relieved.</p>

<p>How this disaster happened it is not easy to explain.
Exaggerated native reports of the immense hordes of
Khyburees, who were assembling in the pass, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in circulation; and the regiments seem to have commenced
their march, anticipating such formidable opposition
as they were never doomed to encounter. The
ominous intelligence from Caubul had alarmed them.
The lies spread abroad by the Sikhs had probably
alarmed them still more. The opposition was not
strenuous.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Had the regiments been in good heart,
they would not have been beaten back. But there was
anything but a strong forward feeling among them when
they commenced their march. The defection of the
Sikhs had damped their ardour, and the breaking down
of the guns now seemed to complete what the misconduct
of our allies had commenced. The first attacks
of the enemy threw the Sepoys at the head of the
column into confusion; and all hope of success was at
an end before a battle had been fought.</p>

<p>The two regiments that occupied Ali-Musjid might
have held that post for any length of time against the
Khyburees. But they had a lamentable scarcity of
provisions. The water, too, seemed to poison them.
The troops were put upon half-rations, but, in spite of
this, in a few days the supplies were nearly exhausted.
Without bedding and without tents, kept ever on the
alert, under a severe climate, and under depressing
influences, the health and spirits of the Sepoys were
giving way. They were crowding into hospital. There
seemed to be no prospect of relief; so, on the 23rd of
January, Colonel Moseley determined to evacuate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fortress of Ali-Musjid, and to cut his way back to
Jumrood.</p>

<p>To Mackeson, who saw clearly the political evils that
must result from the surrender of so important a position,
this was a heavy blow. Anything seemed better
than the total abandonment of such a post. A small
party of resolute men might hold it; for a small party
might be fed. There were at least two men in the garrison
eager for the proud distinction of holding, in an
imminent conjuncture, a dangerous isolated post against
a multitudinous enemy. Captain Burt, of the 64th
Native Infantry, volunteered to remain with a party of
regular troops; but the Sepoys would not volunteer.
Captain Thomas, of the same corps&mdash;the staff officer of
the detachment&mdash;a man of a bold and fearless nature, and
of large acquirements&mdash;stepped forward and volunteered
to hold the fortress with 150 men of the old Eusofzye
garrison. The offer was accepted; arrangements were
made for the defence; but the fidelity of the Eusofzyes,
which had been long failing, now broke down altogether.
They refused to occupy the dangerous post
after the departure of the Sepoy regiments; and so, on
the 24th, the entire force moved out of Ali-Musjid, and
suffered it to fall into the hands of the Afreedis.</p>

<p>“The regiments are safe through&mdash;thank God!” was
the emphatic announcement which Captain Lawrence, on
the 24th of January, forwarded by express to Mr. George
Clerk. It had been a time of intense and painful excitement.
The communications between the two detachments
were cut off, and anxious as they were to act in concert
with each other, they had, up to the evening of the 22nd,
failed to ascertain the intentions of each other, and to
effect a combined movement.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> On the 23rd, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
regiments which Wild had commanded, now, owing to the
Brigadier’s wound, under the charge of Colonel Tulloch,
with the two serviceable Sikh guns, went forward to line
the pass, and cover the march of Moseley’s regiments;
but no sound of an advancing column was heard, and
about mid-day they returned to camp. On the following
morning they moved out again. Moseley had quitted
Ali-Musjid, and was making the best of his way to
Jumrood. The Khyburees mustered strong; but the
Sepoy corps in both detachments did their duty well
and the regiments made good their passage. Captain
Wilson, of the 64th, was killed at the head of his men;
and Captain Lock, of the 60th, fell also with his sword
in his hand. There was some loss of baggage on the
retreat&mdash;some of the sick and wounded were abandoned;
and the general conduct of the affair is not to be dwelt
upon with pride or pleasure. But when the four regiments
were once more assembled together at Jumrood,
in spite of the disasters of the week, a general feeling of
relief was experienced; and our officers congratulated one
another, thankful that it was “no worse.”</p>

<p>Nothing was to be done now but to wait patiently for
the arrival of General Pollock and the reinforcements
which were marching up through the Punjaub. It was
obvious that, without cavalry and without guns, every
effort to relieve Jellalabad must be a disastrous failure.
The want of guns was now severely commented upon.
Everybody had something to say about the remissness of
those in high places, who had suffered the advanced
brigade sent for the relief of our beleaguered troops to
appear at the mouth of the Khybur Pass without a single
piece of British artillery. Brigadier Wild lamented the
want of artillery: Colonel Moseley lamented the want
of artillery: Captain Mackeson lamented the want of
artillery. All were certain that the first effort at retrieval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
would not have been a new calamity and a new disgrace,
if a proper complement of British guns had been sent on
with the Sepoy regiments. The omission was a great one,
but it appears to have been more the result of circumstances
than of any culpable negligence on the part of the
military authorities. The four Sepoy regiments, forming
Wild’s brigade, were sent forward by Mr. George Clerk,
on a requisition from Captain Mackeson. Mackeson
wrote for the immediate despatch of the troops which,
before the outbreak at Caubul, had been warned for the
ordinary relief. The regiments under orders for Afghanistan
were therefore hurried forward, and another regiment,
which was on the frontier, ordered to march with them.
Expedition rather than efficiency was then sought; and
to have got artillery ready for service would have delayed
the despatch of the infantry corps. Captain Lawrence,
himself an artillery officer, saw the expediency of despatching
artillery to Peshawur, and did not omit to
throw out suggestions regarding the preparation of this
important arm; but Mr. George Clerk, who was Captain
Lawrence’s official chief, and subject only to whose confirmation
that officer had any authority to call for the
despatch of troops, did not follow up the intimation of his
subordinate. “Your Excellency will have observed,”
wrote Mr. Clerk to the Commander-in-Chief,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> “that I
have limited the requisitions, which I have presumed to
make upon the commanding officers of Loodhianah and
Ferozepore, to the three infantry regiments which were
already preparing to march to Afghanistan. I consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that this is what Captain Mackeson means in his urgent
request for the despatch of the brigade warned for the
Caubul relief. I therefore have not followed up the
intimation made by Captain Lawrence to the commanding
officer at Ferozepore regarding artillery and cavalry, by
requesting that a detachment of either should move
forward.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that Captain Mackeson, at
Peshawur, limited his requisitions to the troops actually
under orders to proceed, in ordinary routine, to Afghanistan&mdash;that
Captain Lawrence, at Ferozepore, suggested
the expediency of sending forward some guns, if they
could be got ready; and that Mr. Clerk, at Loodhianah,
declined to endorse the suggestion, and left it to the
Commander-in-Chief to decide whether any artillery
should be sent forward with the Sepoy regiments.</p>

<p>But the power of decision was not in the hands of
the Commander-in-Chief. The odium of having sent
forward four Native infantry regiments, without cavalry
and without guns, has been cast upon Sir Jasper Nicolls.
But the truth is, that the regiments had crossed the
Sutlej before he knew that they had been ordered
forward. He was moving upwards towards the frontier
when intelligence of the outbreak in Afghanistan, and
the consequent measures of Mr. Clerk, met him as he
advanced. On the 18th and 20th of November the
two first regiments crossed the Sutlej; and the Commander-in-Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
received the notification of the demand
for these regiments not before the 22nd. On the 26th
of November the two other regiments crossed the Sutlej;
and the Commander-in-Chief did not receive intelligence
of their despatch before the third of December.</p>

<p>Thus far it is plain that no discredit attaches to the
Commander-in-Chief, or to any other authority, for not
having sent forward any guns <i>with</i> Wild’s brigade. But
the question yet remains to be asked why guns were not
sent <i>after</i> it. Though Mr. Clerk, in the first instance,
anxious not to delay the advance of the infantry regiments,
made no requisition for artillery, he directed
General Boyd’s attention to the subject soon after the
despatch of those corps, and suggested that one of Wild’s
regiments should halt on the other side of the Sutlej,
whilst the guns were proceeding to join it.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> As there
was no available artillery at Ferozepore, it was proposed
that Captain Alexander’s troop of Horse Artillery should
move at once from Loodhianah to the former station on
its way across the frontier; but on hearing that the
Commander-in-Chief had ordered some details of a foot
artillery battery to be warned for service, Mr. Clerk
withdrew his requisition for the movement of the troop
beyond the frontier, but still suggested that it should be
pushed on to Ferozepore. This was on the 2nd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
December.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On the 4th, having heard that some delay
must attend the despatch of the details warned by orders
of the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Clerk wrote a letter to
Captain Alexander, requesting him, as the means of more
rapid movement were at his command, to push on across
the Sutlej with all possible expedition.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But a few days
afterwards he received a letter from Sir Jasper Nicolls,
prohibiting the despatch of the Horse Artillery; and he
accordingly apprised Captain Alexander that the request
made to him on the 4th of December for the advance of
the troop was withdrawn.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And so, instead of a troop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Horse Artillery being sent to overtake Wild’s brigade,
which reached Peshawur at the end of December, half of a
foot artillery battery was warned to proceed with M’Caskill’s
brigade, which did not arrive before the beginning
of February. But in the interval, Wild had been disastrously
beaten in the Khybur Pass, and Ali-Musjid had
fallen into the hands of the Afreedis.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the causes of this first failure,
and to whomsoever its responsibility may attach, it is
certain that its results were of a very dispiriting and
deteriorating character.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The regiments remained inactive
in the vicinity of Peshawur; and the usual consequences
of inactivity under such circumstances were soon
painfully apparent in the camp of Brigadier Wild. The
Sepoys fell sick; crowded into hospital; seemed to have
lost all heart, and, without any of the audacity of open
mutiny, broke out into language only a little way removed
from it. Exposed to the alarming hints and the alluring
temptations of the mutinous Sikh soldiery, some began to
desert their colours, whilst others openly declared that
nothing would induce them again to face the horrors of
the Khybur Pass. As General Pollock advanced through
the Punjaub, the worst reports continued to meet him
from Peshawur. Not only was he informed that the
Sepoys of Wild’s brigade were enfeebled by disease and
paralysed by terror; but that even the officers of the
force were using, in an unguarded and unworthy manner,
the language of disheartenment and alarm.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 5th of February, General Pollock reached Peshawur;
and found that the stories, which had met him
on the road, had by no means exaggerated the condition
of the troops under Brigadier Wild. There were then
1000 men in hospital; and the number was alarmingly
increasing. In a few days it had increased to 1800; so
even with the new brigade, which marched in a day or
two after the General’s arrival, he had, exclusive of
cavalry, scarcely more troops fit for service than Wild
had commanded a month before.</p>

<p>An immediate advance on Jellalabad was not, under
such circumstances, to be contemplated for a moment.
General Pollock had much to do, before he could think of
forcing the Khybur Pass and relieving Jellalabad. The
duties of a General are not limited to operations in the
field. When Pollock reached Peshawur he found that the
least difficult part of the labour before him was the subjugation
of the Afreedi tribes. “Any precipitancy,” wrote
the Commander-in-Chief some time afterwards, “on the
part of a general officer panting for fame might have had
the worst effect.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> To have advanced on Jellalabad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that month of February would have been to precipitate a
strangling failure. Instead of flinging himself headlong
into the pass, Pollock made his way to the hospitals. On
the day after his arrival he visited the sick of the different
regiments, inquired into their wants, conversed with their
medical attendants, endeavoured to ascertain the causes of
the prevalent sickness, and encouraged by every means at
his command, by animating words and assuring promises,
the dispirited and desponding invalids.</p>

<p>Nor was there less to do out of the hospitals. The
<i>morale</i> of the troops was in the lowest possible state. It
seemed, indeed, as though all their soldierly qualities were
at the last gasp. The disaffection of the Sepoys broke out
openly, and four out of the five regiments refused to
advance. Nightly meetings of delegates from the different
regiments of Wild’s brigade were held in camp; and the
26th Regiment of Native Infantry, which had come up
with M’Caskill’s brigade, was soon invited to join the confederacy.
In less than forty-eight hours after the arrival
of that corps, active emissaries from the disaffected regiments
were busy among the men, not only working upon
their fears, but appealing to their religious feelings.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
taint seems to have reached even to some of the officers
of Wild’s brigade, who did not hesitate openly to express
at the mess-table the strongest opinions against a second
attempt to force the Khybur, and to declare their belief
that very few would ever return to Peshawur. One officer
publicly asserted that it would be better to sacrifice Sale’s
brigade than to risk the loss of 12,000 men on the march
to Jellalabad; and another said that, if an advance were
ordered, he would do his best to dissuade every Sepoy of
his corps from again entering the pass.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>To instil new courage and confidence into the waverers
was no easy task; but coolly and sagaciously, as one who
understood the cause of their disheartenment, and could
make some allowances for their misconduct, Pollock
addressed himself to the work of re-animating and re-assuring
them. He made them feel that they had been
placed under the care of one who was mindful of their
welfare and jealous of their honour&mdash;one who overlooked
nothing that contributed to the health and comfort of his
men, and who would never call upon them to make sacrifices
to which he would not cheerfully submit himself.
There was, in all that he did, such an union of kindness
and firmness; he was so mild, so considerate, and yet so
decided, that the Sepoys came in time to regard him with
that child-like faith which, under prosperous circumstances,
is one of their most noticeable characteristics;
and when the hour of trial came they were not found
wanting.</p>

<p>All through the months of February and March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Pollock and his regiments remained inactive in the neighbourhood
of Peshawur. Mortifying as it was to the
General to be compelled to halt so long at the entrance of
the Khybur Pass, no other course was open to him, at the
time, that did not threaten renewed disaster. Pollock’s
position was, doubtless, painful, but it was not perplexing.
His duty in this conjuncture was plain. The eyes of all
India were turned upon him. The safety of the gallant
garrison of Jellalabad was to be secured by his advance.
Sale and Macgregor were writing urgent letters, calling
upon him to push on without delay; but it was still his
duty to halt. The Sepoys were gradually recovering both
their health and their spirits. But reinforcements were
coming across the Punjab, with British dragoons and
horse artillery among them; and nothing did more to
animate and re-assure those who had been discouraged by
previous failure, than the knowledge that when they again
advanced they would be supported by fresh troops, strong
in every branch, and numbering among them a good proportion
of stout European soldiers. Had the advance
been ordered before the arrival of these reinforcements,
it is at least a probable contingency that some of the
native regiments would have stood fast, and, by open
mutiny almost in the face of the enemy, have heaped up
before us a mountain of difficulty, such as no prudence
and no energy on the part of a commander could ever
suffice to overcome.</p>

<p>Still it required much firmness to resist the pressing
appeals made to Pollock by his comrades at the other end
of the Khybur Pass. He had not been many days at
Peshawur before he received a communication from
General Sale, setting forth the exigencies of the Jellalabad
garrison, and urging him to advance to their relief.
The letter was written partly in English and partly in
French, as was much of the correspondence of the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with the view of rendering the work of translation more
difficult. But Sale so often blurted out, in one sentence
of plain English, what he had wrapped up in another of
indifferent French, that his efforts at disguise could hardly
have been successful.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He was too old a soldier to be
very clever in such devices, and he had been too long
fighting the battles of his country in India to write very
unexceptionable French.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">THE DEFENCE OF JELLALABAD.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">January-March: 1842.</p>

<p class="pch">Situation of the Garrison&mdash;Letters from Shah Soojah&mdash;Question of
Capitulation&mdash;Councils of War&mdash;Final Resolution&mdash;Earthquake at
Jellalabad&mdash;Renewal of the Works&mdash;Succours expected.</p>

<p><span class="beg">With</span> heavy hearts did the officers of the Jellalabad
garrison perform the melancholy duties, which devolved
upon them, after the arrival of Dr. Brydon. Horsemen
were sent out to explore the surrounding country, and to
bring in, if any could be found, the bodies of the dead.
Hopes, too, were entertained, that some survivors of the
terrible retreat might still be concealed in the neighbourhood,
or lying wounded by the wayside, unable to struggle
on towards the sheltering walls of the fortress. Every
effort therefore was made, and every precaution taken, to
indicate to the sufferers that succour was at hand, and to
aid them, in their extremity, to reach it. The stillness of
the night was broken by the loud blasts of the bugle,
proclaiming from the ramparts, to any stragglers that
might be toiling through the darkness, the vicinity of the
British camp.</p>

<p>But profitless were all these efforts. The few who had
escaped the massacre in the passes were captives in the
hands of the Afghans; and the Jellalabad officers now
asked one another whether the fate of the prisoner were
less to be deplored than the fate of the dead. It was
hard to believe that they who had butchered thousands of
their enemies like sheep, in the passes, would treat with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
kindness and respect the few who had fallen into their
hands. The only hope was, that Afghan avarice might be
stronger than Afghan revenge, and that the prisoners might
be preserved, like merchandise, and sold for British gold.</p>

<p>They sorrowed for their unhappy countrymen; but
there was ever present with them the best remedy for
sorrow. They had abundance of work to do. In the
midst of their grief for the destruction of the Caubul
army, it was necessary to consider in what manner that
great catastrophe affected themselves. They reasoned
that, perhaps, for some days, the Afghans would be gorging
themselves with plunder; dividing the spoil; and
burying the corpses of their countrymen; but that, this
done, large bodies of troops would be released, and that
Akbar Khan might soon be expected to come down upon
Jellalabad, with an overwhelming force flushed with victory,
and eager to consign them to the terrible fate which
had overtaken the British army posted at the capital.
It was soon said, that the Sirdar was organising an army,
at Lughman, some thirty miles distant from Jellalabad.
It was necessary, therefore, to prepare for his reception.</p>

<p>To such good purpose had Broadfoot worked, that the
defences of Jellalabad were now fast becoming formidable
realities; and the officers said among themselves and
wrote to distant friends, that nothing but a failure of
provisions, or ammunition, could give the Sirdar a chance
of carrying the place. Our fighting men, however, were
too few to man the works with good effect. Sale, therefore,
embodied the camp-followers; and thus enabled
himself to employ his effective troops beyond the walls.
Day after day, foraging parties were sent out with good
results. Our great requirements were wood and grass.
It was expedient to obtain these as expeditiously as possible,
for the place might soon be invested; and then the
garrison would be thrown back entirely on its internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
supplies. About the same time, all the Afghans in Jellalabad,
including 200 men of Ferris’s Jezailchee regiment,
were ordered to quit the walls, in the belief that in an
extremity they would certainly turn against us.</p>

<p>Then news came of Wild’s failure. To the younger and
bolder spirits in Sale’s brigade, this was scarcely a disappointment.
They had expected little from Wild’s
advance. They believed, however, that the disaster
would necessarily retard Pollock’s forward movement;
and in this there was something discouraging. But they
said among themselves that they could hold out till May,
that it was then only January, and that it was hard,
indeed, if Pollock could not relieve them within the next
three months.</p>

<p>But whilst everything appeared thus plain to the
younger and the irresponsible officers of the Jellalabad
force, difficulties were rising up before the eyes, and
doubts were assailing the minds of the responsible chiefs.
Already had they begun to question, whether the Government
at Calcutta had any intention to make a genuine
effort, on a sufficient scale, to relieve them. All that they
had heard of the views and measures of Lord Auckland
led them to the painful conclusion that they would be
left to their fate; at all events, until the arrival of his
successor. In the meanwhile, not only was Akbar Khan
collecting an army in Lughman, but Shah Soojah himself,
acting perhaps under compulsion&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;was preparing
to despatch troops both to Ghuznee and Jellalabad
for the expulsion of the Feringhee garrisons. From the
Shah nothing was to be expected beyond, at best, a little
friendly delay. On the 21st of January, Macgregor
received a letter from him. It contained much about
the past; it alleged that if the Shah’s advice had
not been disregarded, all would have gone well; that
he alone could now hold the country, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wanted nothing from us but money.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This was a
long, private letter&mdash;somewhat incoherent&mdash;the work
of the King himself. But another also came from the
King, as from the head of the government, asking the
English at Jellalabad what were their intentions. “Your
people,” it said, in effect, “have concluded a treaty with
us, consenting to leave the country. You are still in
Jellalabad. What are your intentions? Tell us quickly.”
What now was to be done?</p>

<p>The crisis was a perilous one; the responsibility was
great. Sale and Macgregor were sorely perplexed. It
was plain that by continuing to occupy Jellalabad, they
could do nothing to support their comrades in Afghanistan;
for the Caubul army had been destroyed, and the
Candahar and Ghuznee garrisons would fall back, if at all,
on Scinde. They were not bound to support Shah Soojah,
for the Shah himself declared that he wanted nothing but
our money, and was evidently compromised with his own
countrymen by our continued occupation of Jellalabad.
The safety of the prisoners appeared more likely to be
secured by our departure from Afghanistan than by our
continuing in a hostile attitude in one of the chief places
of the kingdom. And it was at least doubtful whether
the policy of the Government at Calcutta would not be
aided rather than embarrassed by the withdrawal of the
garrison to Peshawur.</p>

<p>All these considerations weighing heavily on his mind,
Sale determined to summon a Council of War. On the
26th of January, the Council met at the General’s quarters.
It was composed of the commanding-officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
different components of his varied force.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The political
officer, Macgregor, was also a member of the Council. On
him devolved the duty of explaining the circumstances
which had induced the general to call them together. All
the letters and documents bearing upon the great question
were read and laid upon the table. Macgregor, acting
as spokesman, declared that it was his opinion, and that
also of the General, that little was to be hoped from the
efforts of Government to relieve them. It was obvious
that they must trust to themselves. Shah Soojah
appeared to desire their departure; he had virtually,
indeed, directed it. Were the members of the Council,
he asked, of like opinion with himself and Sale, that it
was now their duty to treat with the Shah for the evacuation
of the country?</p>

<p>Then Macgregor read to the Council the terms of the
proposed letter to the King. It set forth that his
Majesty’s letter had been received; that the British held
Jellalabad and the country only for the King, and that as
it was his desire that they should return to India, of
course they were willing to do so. But that after what
had happened, it was necessary that the manner and the
conditions of their withdrawal should be clearly understood.
The terms upon which the garrison of Jellalabad
would consent to evacuate the country were these: that
they would give four hostages in proof of their sincerity;
that the King should send a force to escort them in
honour and safety to Jellalabad&mdash;that is, with their arms,
colours, guns, &amp;c.; that the escort should be commanded
by one of the Prince’s own sons; and that carriage and
supplies should be furnished for our march; that Mahomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Akbar and his force were to be withdrawn from
Lughman before the British quitted Jellalabad; and that
hostages should be given by the Afghans to accompany
the British force as far as Peshawur, and there to be
exchanged for our own hostages and prisoners; these
hostages to be a son of the Newab Zemaun Khan&mdash;a son
of Ameen-oollah Khan&mdash;Sooltan Jan, said to be a favourite
cousin of Mahomed Akbar&mdash;with some Shinwarree and
Khyburee chiefs.</p>

<p>Great now was the excitement in the Council; earnest
the discourse. Men lifted up their voices together, in
vehement debate, eager to speak, little caring to listen.
Arguments were enunciated with such warmth of language,
that they lost all their argumentative force. It
was apparent, however, that the feelings of the majority
of the Council were in favour of withdrawal. There was
a prevailing sense amongst them that they had been
abandoned by the Government at Calcutta; that there
was no intention to maintain the supremacy of our arms
in Afghanistan; that Shah Soojah did not wish them
to remain there; and that, if they could make their
own way to Peshawur, they would best fulfil the desires
of their masters, and that their first care should be to
further the views of the Government which they served.
And yet their indignation ran high against that Government,
which had abandoned them in the hour of their need.</p>

<p>But against all this there was one officer who steadfastly
set his face; who had viewed with horror and detestation
the proposal to capitulate, and flung the paper
of terms indignantly on the ground. This was George
Broadfoot, of the Sappers. Eagerly he lifted up his voice
against the proposal; eagerly he declared it to be impossible
that the Government should leave them to their
fate, and do nothing to restore our lost national reputation
in Afghanistan; eagerly he set forth to his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that a new Governor-General was coming, doubtless
with new counsels, from England; that the Duke of
Wellington was in power at home, and that so inglorious
a policy could never ultimately prevail. But he lacked,
in that conjuncture, the self-restraint, the moderation of
language, and the calmness of utterance which might have
secured for him respectful attention. They said that he
was violent, and he was. Even his best friends said afterwards,
that his warmth was unbecoming, and, doubtless,
it weakened his cause. It was soon apparent to him
that in the existing temper of the council, he could do
nothing to change their resolves. He determined, therefore,
to endeavour to delay the final resolution, and, with
this object proposed an adjournment of the Council. The
proposal was carried; the Council was dissolved, and the
members went to their quarters or to their posts, to talk,
or brood over what had happened, and to fortify themselves
with new arguments in support of the opinions
which they had determined to maintain.</p>

<p>The Council met again on the following day. There
was much and earnest discussion; but it was painfully
obvious that the majority were in favour of capitulation,
and that at the head of the majority were the military
and political chiefs. The proposed terms were again
brought under review, and again George Broadfoot lifted
up his voice against them. He was told by his opponents
in the Council that the warmth of his feelings had obscured
his judgment; but, resolute not to weaken his advocacy
of so great a cause by any frailty of his own, he had submitted
his views to writing, and had invited the sober
criticism of his calmer friend Henry Havelock.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> With
this paper in his hand, holding his eager temperament in
restraint, he now did resolute battle against the proposal
for surrender. First, he took the votes of the Council on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the general question of the propriety of any negociation;
and then, one by one, he combated the separate terms of
the proposed treaty of surrender. But, two only excepted,
his comrades were all against him. Backhouse, a man of
fiery courage and of plain discourse, though recognising
the force of much of Macgregor’s reasoning, voted against
withdrawal. Oldfield said little, but that little, with his
vote, was against capitulation. Havelock, who attended
only as the General’s staff, was without a vote; but his
heart was with those who voted for the manlier and the
nobler course.</p>

<p>The chief spokesmen were, George Macgregor on the
one side, and George Broadfoot on the other. The
former, enunciating the views of his military chief, contended
that the Jellalabad garrison had been abandoned
by the Government; that after Wild’s failure, no movement
for their release was likely to be made; that there
was no possibility that their little force could hold its
own much longer, and that it could not retreat except
under terms with the victorious enemy. He believed
that the terms, of which he had spoken, would be strictly
observed. Macnaghten and Pottinger had failed to take
hostages from the Afghans, and therefore our army
had been destroyed; but hostages being given, it was
urged, the treaty would never be violated, and on the
arrival of the force at Peshawur, our prisoners would be
surrendered. Moreover, as Macgregor had contended
from the first, the British troops held Jellalabad, and
every other post in the Afghan dominions, only on behalf
of Shah Soojah; and if the Shah directed our withdrawal,
we had no right, it was said, to remain, especially
when our own Government apparently desired the
speedy evacuation of the country.</p>

<p>But this Broadfoot denied. He denied that the British
troops held Jellalabad only on behalf of Shah Soojah; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
denied that the British Government&mdash;under whose orders
alone, he contended, the force could with propriety be
withdrawn from Jellalabad&mdash;had directed, or were likely
to direct, the immediate evacuation of Afghanistan. He
denied that the brigade could not hold out in Jellalabad;
he denied that it could not make good its retreat to
Peshawur. He declared that hostages had been given
before, at Tezeen&mdash;that still our camp had been attacked;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and that, so long as the enemy held our hostages and
prisoners in their hands, there was really little additional
security in such a resource. Sale said that he would
execute an Afghan hostage if the terms of the treaty
were violated. “Would you do this,” asked Broadfoot,
“if the enemy threatened to kill, before our faces, two
English ladies for every man that we put to death?” It
was urged, by another officer, that if the British troops
did not evacuate Jellalabad, our hostages at Caubul
would be murdered. “Then,” contended Broadfoot, “in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
such a warfare, the most barbarous must be most successful.
Whoever is prepared to execute his hostages and
prisoners must gain his object, and triumph by the mere
force of his barbarity.”</p>

<p>And thus, point after point, Broadfoot combated the
arguments of those who supported the policy of capitulation;
and at last took his stand boldly upon “first principles.”
When it was said that a body of troops, thus
abandoned by Government, were entitled to look to their
own safety, he replied, that they had a right to save the
troops only when, by so doing, they would confer a
greater benefit on the state than by risking their loss.
And when mention was made of the views of the Governor-General,
the chief officer of the state, he declared that
there was a higher duty still which they were bound to
discharge. If, as had been contended, the Government of
India had abandoned them, the covenant between them
was cancelled by the failure of the higher authority.
But they had a duty to perform towards their country&mdash;a
duty which they could never decline. And it was plainly
their duty, in the conjuncture which had arisen, to uphold
the honour of the nation. In these views Havelock
openly concurred; though, for reasons already stated, he
took little part in the debates.</p>

<p>The terms of the proposed capitulation were carried,
with but one exception. It was determined that hostages
should not be given. Macgregor volunteered himself to
be one; and both he and Sale contended vehemently in
support of the proposal; but the voice of the assembly
was against it. Its rejection detracted little from the
humiliation of the surrender; and Broadfoot stood forward
in the hope of persuading his comrades to reconsider
the remaining terms. He dwelt especially on the discredit
of demanding the withdrawal of Akbar Khan from
Lughman, as though they stood in fear of the Sirdar; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
urged upon them the expediency of requiring the surrender
of all the British prisoners in the hands of the
Afghans, as a preliminary to the evacuation of Jellalabad;
and he implored them to consider whether, if they were
determined to abandon their position, they could not
give some dignity to the movement, by imparting to it
the character of a military operation, deceiving the enemy
as to real intention, and fighting, if need be, their way
down to Peshawur. All these proposals were overruled.
At a later date, the last received some support from men
who had before condemned it.</p>

<p>And so, slightly altered in its phraseology&mdash;which
Broadfoot had denounced as too abject&mdash;the letter was
carried through the Council and prepared for transmission
to the Shah. After the votes had been given, Broadfoot
sarcastically congratulated them on the figure that they
would make if the relieving force arrived just as the
brigade was marching out of Jellalabad, under the terms
of a humiliating convention. In such a case, Dennie,
who had not the clearest possible perception of the obligations
of good faith in such matters, declared that he
would not go. Upon which he was told that he would
be “made to go;” and the Council broke up amidst
greater hilarity than had inaugurated its assemblage.</p>

<p>The letter was despatched to Shah Soojah, and, amidst
varied and contending emotions, the members of the
Council awaited a reply. In the meanwhile some of them
recorded their reasons for the votes they had given; and
all earnestly considered the course to be pursued when the
expected answer should be received from Caubul. There
could be little difference of opinion upon this score. It
was determined that, if the answer received from the
Shah should be a simple and unconditional acceptance of
the proposed terms, the garrison must at once evacuate
Jellalabad, and, if faith were broken by the enemy, fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
its way to Peshawur; but that, if the answer should be
evasive or clogged with reservations and conditions, they
would be at liberty to adopt any course that might seem
most expedient to them.</p>

<p>The answer came. It called upon the chief officers at
Jellalabad, if they were sincere in their proposals, to affix
their seals to the letter. A Council of war was held. Sale
and Macgregor urged the members to put their seals to
a copy of the original paper of terms. Broadfoot, pleading
that the nature of the Shah’s letter, expressing a doubt, as
it did, of their sincerity, liberated them from all foregone
obligations, proposed that the whole question of capitulation
should be reconsidered. He then offered to the acceptance
of the Council the draft of a letter, stating that as the
Shah and his chiefs had not answered their former communication&mdash;either
by accepting or rejecting the proposed
terms&mdash;that they should be referred to the Governor-General.
There was much warm discussion. The proposed
letter was pronounced violent, and eventually rejected.
Another letter to the same effect, but more temperate in
its tone, was proposed by Backhouse, and also rejected.
Sale denounced, in strong language, the opposition of
these men; some still more vehement discussion followed,
and the council was adjourned.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards the members re-assembled, they
who had felt and spoken hotly had cooled down; and the
debate was resumed more gravely and decorously than it
had broken off. Colonel Dennie and Captain Abbott had,
by this time, determined to support the proposal for
holding out, and Colonel Monteith, who had before
recorded his opinions in favour of the course recommended
by Major Macgregor, now prepared a letter, which, though
couched in much less decided terms than those proposed
by Broadfoot and Backhouse, was not a renewal of the
negotiation. After some discussion this was accepted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the council, and a messenger was despatched to Caubul
with the important missive. It left them free to act as they
should think fit;&mdash;most happily it left them free, for the
next day brought tidings from Peshawur that large reinforcements
were moving up through the Punjab, and that
strenuous efforts were to be made for their relief. It was
clear that the government had not abandoned them to
their fate. It was now equally clear to all, that it was
their duty to hold out to the last hour. There was no
more talk of withdrawal.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>This was on the 13th of February. The garrison were
in good heart, and the fortifications of Jellalabad were
rising rapidly around them. In spite of all opposition at
Caubul&mdash;in spite of the counsels of Alexander Burnes, who
heartily despised the enemy&mdash;in spite of a sneering
remark from the envoy, that the sappers would have
nothing to do but to pick a few stones from under the
gun-wheels, Broadfoot had insisted on taking with him a
good supply of working tools, some of which he had
ordered to be made for him, by forced labour, in the city;
and had sent an urgent indent on the march for further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
supplies.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It seemed, he said afterwards, “as though
Providence had stiffened his neck on this occasion;” for
now at Jellalabad, he found himself with implements of
all kinds and with large supplies of blasting powder, able
alike to make and to destroy. And gallantly the good
work proceeded, in prospect, too, of an immediate attack,
for Akbar Khan, with the white English tents which proclaimed
our disgrace, was within a few miles of the walls
which we were turning into formidable defences.</p>

<p>But a great calamity was now about to befall the Jellalabad
garrison. On the morning of the 19th of February
the men were busied with their accustomed labour. With
their arms piled within reach, they were plying axe and
shovel, toiling with their wonted cheerfulness and activity
at the defences, which they had begun to look upon with
the satisfied air of men who had long seen their work
growing under their hands, and now recognised the near
approach of its completion. They had worked, indeed, to
good purpose. Very different were the fortifications of
Jellalabad from what they had been when Sale entered
the place in November.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> They were now real, not nominal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
defences. The unremitting toil of nearly three months
had not been without its visible and appreciable results.
It seemed, too, as though the work were about to be completed
just at the time when the defences were most
needed. Akbar Khan was in the neighbourhood of Jellalabad,
and every day Sale expected to be called upon to
meet the flower of the Barukzye horse on the plain. But
on this 19th of February, when the garrison were flushed
with joy at the thought of the near completion of their
work, a fearful visitation of Providence, suddenly and
astoundingly, turned all their labour to very nothingness.
There was an awful and mysterious sound, as of thunder
beneath their feet; then the earth shook; the houses of
the town trembled and fell; the ramparts of the fort
seemed to reel and totter, and presently came down with
a crash.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> On the first sound of the threatened convulsion
the men had instinctively rushed to their arms, and the
greater number had escaped the coming ruin; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
still among those recollections of the defence which are
dwelt upon by the “illustrious garrison” in the liveliest
spirit of jocularity, how the field-officer of the day&mdash;a
gallant and good soldier&mdash;but one who had more regard
for external proprieties than was generally appreciated in
those days, was buried beneath a heap of rubbish, and how
he was extricated from his perilous position by some men
of the 13th, under circumstances which even now they
enjoy in their retrospect with a relish which years have
not impaired.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>But although the earthquake which threw down the
walls of Jellalabad, wrought in a minute more irreparable
mischief than a bombarding army could have done in a
month, in nowise disheartened by this calamity, the garrison
again took the spade and the pick-axe into their
hands, and toiled to repair the mischief. “No time,”
says Captain Broadfoot, “was lost.advanced in two heavy columns The shocks had
scarcely ceased when the whole garrison was told off into
working parties, and before night the breaches were
scarped, the rubbish below cleared away, and the ditches
before them dug out, whilst the great one on the Peshawur
side was surrounded by a good gabion parapet. A parapet
was erected on the remains of the north-west bastion,
with an embrasure allowing the guns to flank the approach
of the ruined Caubul gate; the parapet of the new bastion
was restored, so as to give a flanking fire to the north-west
bastion, whilst the ruined gate was rendered inaccessible
by a trench in front of it, and in every bastion
round the place a temporary parapet was raised. From
the following day all the troops off duty were continually
at work, and such was their energy and perseverance, that
by the end of the month the parapets were entirely
restored, or the curtain filled in where restoration was
impracticable, and every battery re-established. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
breaches have been built up, with the rampart doubled
in thickness, and the whole of the gates retrenched.”&mdash;Such,
indeed, was the extraordinary vigour thrown
into the work of restoration&mdash;such the rapidity with
which the re-establishment of the defences was completed,
that the enemy, seeing soon afterwards no traces of the
great earthquake-shock of the 19th of February, declared
that the phenomenon must have been the result of
English witchcraft, for that Jellalabad was the only place
that had escaped.</p>

<p>If Akbar Khan, who at this time was within a few
miles of Sale’s position, knew the extent to which the
defences of Jellalabad had been weakened, he committed
a strange oversight in not taking advantage of such a
casualty. The garrison felt assured that the Barukzyes
would not throw away such a chance; and they made up
their minds resolutely for the encounter. Intelligence
had just been received of the publication of the government
manifesto of the 31st of January; and this spasmodic
burst of energy and indignation, welcomed as an
indication of the intention of the Supreme Government
to wipe out at all hazards the stains that had been fixed
upon the national honour, fortified and re-assured the
heroes of Jellalabad, who had so long been grieving over
the apparent feebleness and apathy of the official magnates
at Calcutta.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Sale published the proclamation in garrison orders; and
the result did not belie his expectation. Like the chiefs of
the Jellalabad force, the junior officers and men had felt,
with acute mortification, the neglect to which they had
seemingly been subjected.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But now, that Lord Auckland
had declared that he regarded the disasters that had
befallen us merely as so many new opportunities of demonstrating
the military power of the British Empire in the
East, the hearts of the brave men, who had been so long
defying the enemy that had destroyed Elphinstone’s army,
again began to leap up with hope and exultation; and as
they saw their defences rising again, almost as it were by
supernatural agency, before their eyes, they began rather to
regret the caution of the Barukzye chief, which seemed to
restrain him from venturing under the walls of Jellalabad.</p>

<p>There seems, indeed, to have been in the Afghan camp
a strange shrinking from anything like a hand-to-hand
encounter with the intrepid soldiers of Sale’s brigade.
The reluctance of Akbar Khan to near the walls of
Jellalabad is a painful commentary upon the arrogance
and audacity of the Afghans, who a few weeks before had
been bearding Elphinstone and Shelton under the shadow
of the Caubul cantonments. Akbar Khan now seemed
resolute to risk nothing by any dashing movement, that
might decide, at once, the fate of the Jellalabad garrison.
Instead of assaulting the place he blockaded it.</p>

<p>He seemed to trust to the efficacy of a close investment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and so moved in his troops nearer and nearer to
our walls, hoping to effect that by starvation which he
could not effect by hard fighting in the field. And so,
for some time, he continued, drawing in more and more
closely&mdash;harassing our foraging parties, and occasionally
coming into contact with the horsemen who were sent out
to protect the grass-cutters. Not, however, before the
11th of March was there any skirmishing worthy of
record. Then it was reported that the enemy were about
to mine the place. <i>Sungahs</i> had been thrown up on the
night of the 10th, and the enemy were firing briskly
from behind them. It was plain that some mischief was
brewing; so on the morning of the 11th, Sale, keeping
his artillery at the guns on the ramparts, sent out a
strong party of infantry and cavalry, with two hundred
of Broadfoot’s sappers. Dennie commanded the sortie.
As they streamed out of the Peshawur gate of the city,
Akbar Khan seemed inclined to give them battle. But
ever as the enemy advanced the hot fire from our guns
drove them back. They could not advance upon our
works, nor protect the <i>sungahs</i> which our skirmishers
were rapidly destroying. It was soon ascertained that
the story of the mine was a mere fable; ammunition was
too scarce to be expended on any but necessary service;
so there was nothing more to be done. Dennie sounded
the recall. The British troops began to fall back upon
their works; and then the enemy, emboldened by the
retrograde movement, fell upon our retiring column. No
sooner had our people halted and reformed, than the
Afghans turned and fled, but still they wrought us some
mischief, for they wounded Broadfoot; and those were
days when an accident to the garrison engineer was,
indeed, a grievous calamity. Not a man, however, of
Sale’s brigade was killed. The carnage was all among
the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of the month passed quietly away&mdash;but
the anxieties of the garrison were steadily increasing.
Provisions had become scarce; ammunition was scarce;
fodder for the horses was not to be obtained. It was
obviously the design of the enemy to reduce the garrison
by a strict blockade. It would be difficult to exaggerate
the eagerness with which, under such circumstances, they
looked for the arrival of succours from Peshawur. Excellent
as were Pollock’s reasons for not proceeding to
the relief of Jellalabad until his force was strengthened
by the arrival of the European regiments on their way to
Peshawur, it is easy to understand, and impossible to
condemn, the eagerness with which Sale and Macgregor
continued to exhort him to advance for their succour.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Pollock had expected that the dragoons would reach
Peshawur by the 20th of March; but on the 27th they
had not arrived; and the General wrote to Jellalabad,
explaining the causes of delay, but still hoping that he
would be able to commence his march on the last day of
the month. “There appears,” he wrote, “to be nothing
but accidents to impede the advance of the dragoons.
They were five days crossing the Ravee. I have sent out
300 camels to help them in; and I hope nothing will
prevent my moving on the 31st. God knows I am most
anxious to move on, for I know that delay will subject us
to be exposed to very hot weather. But my situation
has been most embarrassing. Any attempt at a forward
movement in the early part of this month I do not think
would have succeeded, for at one time the Hindoos did
not hesitate to say that they would <i>not</i> go forward. I
hope the horror they had has somewhat subsided; but
without more white faces I question even now if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
would go. Since the 1st we have been doing all to
recover a proper tone; but you may suppose what my
feelings have been, wishing to relieve you, and knowing
that my men would not go. However desirable it is that
I should be joined by the 31st Regiment, your late letters
compel me to move, and I hope, therefore, to be with you
by about the 7th. I cannot say the day exactly, because
I want to take Ali-Musjid. When that is taken, your
situation may, perhaps, become better.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The dragoons
reached Pollock’s camp on the 30th, and on the following
day he began to move forward.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">[April, 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Forcing of the Khybur Pass&mdash;State of the Sikh Troops&mdash;Mr. Clerk
at the Court of Lahore&mdash;Views of the Lahore Durbar&mdash;Efforts of
Shere Singh&mdash;Assemblage of the Army at Jumrood&mdash;Advance to
Ali-Musjid&mdash;Affairs at Jellalabad&mdash;Defeat of Akbar Khan&mdash;Junction

<p><span class="beg">Whatever</span> embarrassments may have lain in the way
of General Pollock during these months of February and
March, and compelled him, eager as he was to advance to
the relief of Jellalabad, to remain inactive at Peshawur, it
is certain that they were greatly increased by the reluctance
of our Sikh allies to face the passes of the Khybur.
The conduct of the Nujeeb battalions, which had mutinied
on the very eve of Wild’s movement into the pass,
left no room to hope for any effectual co-operation from
that source. All the efforts of Captain Lawrence to
obtain any assistance from the Sikh troops at Peshawur,
through General Mehtab Singh,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> had failed; and Lawrence
was of opinion that the General’s conduct, in admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the Afreedis into his camp, had established such a clear
case of hostility, that he and his traitrous followers ought
to be dismissed with disgrace. But now that Rajah
Gholab Singh, accompanied by the Crown Prince of
Lahore, was advancing with his regiments to Peshawur, as
those regiments were composed of a different class of men,
and the influence of the Rajah over these hill-levies was
great, it was hoped, that on his junction with General
Pollock’s camp, a new order of things would be established.
But it soon became painfully evident to the General that
very little cordial co-operation was to be looked for from
the Jummoo Rajah and his troops.</p>

<p>When, early in February, Pollock, on his way back to
Peshawur, reached the Attock, he found the left bank of
the river occupied by the Sikh troops under Gholab Singh,
whilst the Nujeeb battalions, which had disgraced themselves
a few weeks before, were posted on the opposite
side.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Captain Lawrence, who had left Peshawur to
expedite the Rajah’s movements, was then in the Sikh
camp; and M’Caskill’s brigade was a few marches in the
rear. There appeared every likelihood, therefore, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
collision that would impede the progress of the British
troops; but the exertions of Pollock and Lawrence were
crowned with success; and the Sikh force moved off before
M’Caskill’s brigade arrived on the banks of the river. On
the 14th, Gholab Singh and the Prince reached Peshawur.
On the 20th, Pollock held a conference with the Rajah&mdash;Lawrence
and Mackeson being present&mdash;and a day or two
afterwards, forwarding an abstract of the conversation that
had taken place between them, wrote to the Supreme
Government: “I confess that I have no expectation of
any assistance from the Sikh troops.”</p>

<p>On the conduct of Gholab Singh at this time, some
suspicion has been cast. It has been said that he not
only instigated, through the agency of an influential messenger,
the Nujeeb battalions to rebel, but carried on a
friendly correspondence with our Afghan enemies at
Caubul. That there was no hearty co-operation, is true;
but hearty co-operation was not to be expected. Gholab
Singh had other work on hand at that time; and, whilst
he was playing and losing a great game in Thibet, it
would have been strange, indeed, if he had thrown his
heart into the work which he was called upon to perform
for others at the mouth of the Khybur Pass. He had no
confidence in his troops. He had no inducement to exert
himself.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The latter obstacle, it was thought, might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
removed; and Lawrence and Mackeson were of opinion
that it would be well to bribe him into activity by the
offer of Jellalabad, to be held by him independently of
the Sikh ruler; but Mr. Clerk was of opinion that such a
measure would be neither politic nor honest.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It would,
indeed, at that time, have been an injustice done by the
British Government against both the other parties to the
tripartite treaty. It would have injuriously affected both
Shah Soojah and Shere Singh; and would have involved
the Jummoo Rajah in difficulties and perplexities from
which he would have found it difficult to extricate himself.
Indeed, Captain Mackeson himself very soon came to the
opinion that, if we desired to bribe Gholab Singh into
co-operation by promises of territorial aggrandisement, it
was necessary that we should lay our finger on some other
part of the map than that which represented Jellalabad;
and he asked whether Shikarpoor, which Runjeet Singh
had coveted, and which the tripartite treaty had snatched
from him, “would not do better.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the mean while, it appeared to Mr. Clerk that his
presence at the Court of the Sikh ruler, would have the
effect of cementing the alliance between the two states,
and enable him the better to obtain from the Lahore
Government the military assistance that was so greatly
needed. He had never doubted the good faith of the
Maharajah himself. Whatever selfish motives he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have attributed to him, it was not to be doubted that at
this time his feelings and his conduct alike were those of a
friend. Clerk declared that no native state had ever
taken such great pains to accelerate the movements of our
troops by preventing plunder, supplying boats at the
ferries, and furnishing food for the use of our army. The
Maharajah had given us the best aid and the best advice,
and in the opinion of the British agent was willing to act
up to the spirit of the Tripartite treaty. He was, indeed,
the only man in the Punjab who really desired our
success.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March, Clerk arrived at Umritsur,
resolute to “get what he could out of the Sikhs.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Early on the following morning he waited on Shere
Singh. The first visit was a visit of condolence on the
deaths of Kurruck Singh and his son. The attendance
at the Durbar was small. No troops were in waiting
beyond a single wing of a battalion drawn up to salute
the arrival and departure of the British Mission. The
Court were in mourning of white. Everything about the
Durbar was quiet and subdued. It was a meeting of
condolence on both sides. Clerk’s expressions of regret
were reciprocated by those which the Sikh ruler freely
uttered with reference to the death of Sir William Macnaghten.
Dhyan Singh and the Fakir Azizoodeen were
both loud in their praises of the envoy; and expressed a
lively hope that the treacherous Afghans would be duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
punished for their offences. After other complimentary
interchanges, the Mission departed; and on the following
morning proceeded to pay a visit of congratulation to the
new ruler. The Court now wore a different aspect.
Along the garden-walks stretched walls of crimson broadcloth,
and lines of armed Goorcherrahs, in new appointments,
glittered along the paths. Everything was bright
and joyous. The courtiers shone in splendid apparel.
The Maharajah himself was bright with jewels, of which
the <i>Koh-i-noor</i> was the lustrous chief. The young Rajah
Heera Singh, old Runjeet’s minion, radiant with emeralds
and pearls, sate beside Shere Singh, whilst his father, the
minister, stood beside the regal chair. The officers of
the British Mission sate on a row of chairs opposite; and
the old Fakir Azizoodeen was seated on the floor beside
the chair of the British chief. The conversation was of a
general and complimentary character. The <i>Khelat</i> of
accession was presented to the new ruler; the fidelity
of the Sikh Government and the character of its administration
were belauded; and then the Mission took its
departure.</p>

<p>On the 5th, Clerk, having intimated his desire to wait
on the Maharajah, to discuss matters of business, was
invited to attend at his own time. He went in the afternoon;
and at once solicited the honour of a private
audience. Heera Singh was sitting beside him, and other
courtiers were in attendance. A motion of the hand
dismissed them all; and Clerk was invited to seat himself
in Heera Singh’s chair. But the British minister, not
wishing that the conversation should be carried on without
any witnesses, suggested the recall of Dhyan Singh and
the Fakir, who, with Heera Singh and one or two others,
were present at the interview. Clerk had a difficult game
to play at this time. He had to obtain the most effectual
co-operation of the Sikh Government that could be elicited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in this hour of trial; and yet he was unwilling to lay
bare to the Sikh Durbar the real designs of his own
government. He had been directed to disclose those
designs to the Sikhs&mdash;to intimate that it was the intention
of the British government, after rescuing the Jellalabad
garrison, to withdraw the army to the British frontier;
but inwardly indignant at the feebleness of the policy
which was favoured at Calcutta, he shrunk from avowing
these intentions of withdrawal, and endeavoured rather to
elicit the views of the Lahore Cabinet than to expose the
designs of his own. But Shere Singh was not inclined to
be less cautious than the British envoy. When Clerk
asked what he intended to do to rescue Sale’s garrison
from destruction, the Maharajah replied that the Sikhs
were very desirous to aid the British Government, but
that the matter called for consideration. Bristling up at
the coolness of this reply, Clerk said that the whole
question of the alliance between the two states might call
for future consideration; but that the present moment
when the safety of a beleagured garrison was at stake, was
no time for consideration. Qualifying then his former
remark, the Sikh ruler said that he meant only that the
mode of procedure called for consideration, and he began
to talk about the advantage of erecting sungahs and
crowning the heights of the Khybur Pass<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>&mdash;to all of
which Clerk readily assented.</p>

<p>Then Dhyan Singh, who all this time had been sitting
silent, with a dejected air and drooping head, looked up,
and with a cheerful countenance began to take part in
the conversation. He had before seemed to think that
the purport of the discussion was to consign his brother,
Gholab Singh, to inevitable destruction; but he now
said that he was certain the troops under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of that chief would willingly co-operate with the British;
but that “an iron lock required an iron key.” He then
abruptly asked why more British troops were not sent;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and the Fakir Azizoodeen whispered the same question.
Clerk could have blurted out an answer to this; but it
was one which would have opened the eyes of the Sikh
Durbar, more than it was desirable to open them, to the
true nature of British policy at this time, and the true
character of our rulers. He, therefore, answered in general
terms that the British government were collecting
troops; but that, nevertheless, the co-operation of the
Sikh Government was much desired; and, whilst he
added that an intimation would be sent to General
Pollock regarding the manner in which the Durbar recommended
the war in the Khybur to be carried on, Shere
Singh promised to send the desired instructions to Gholab
Singh; and so the conference ended.</p>

<p>True to his word, the Maharajah at once despatched
instructions to Gholab Singh to co-operate heartily and
steadily with General Pollock and Captain Mackeson;
and it is believed that at the same time Dhyan Singh
wrote privately to his brother in a similar strain of
exhortation and encouragement. But it was plain to
Mr. Clerk that both the Sovereign and his minister
regarded, with feelings of painful anxiety, the necessity
of avoiding an open rupture with the British Government,
by aiding in the perilous work that lay before the troops
posted at Peshawur. Mr. Clerk remained at the Maharajah’s
Court, which had removed itself from Umritsur to
Lahore, and exerted himself to keep up the fidelity of our
ally to the right point of effective co-operation. But as
time advanced, Shere Singh became more and more uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and apprehensive. It appeared to him that a failure in
the Khybur Pass would bring down such a weight of
unpopularity upon him that his very throne would be
jeopardised by the disaster. One day&mdash;it was the 4th of
April&mdash;holding Durbar in the Huzooree-Bagh, the Maharajah
appeared ill at ease. Having conversed a little
while on general topics, but with an abstracted air, he
ordered the intelligence forwarded to him by the Peshawur
news-writers to be read to the British envoy; then took
him by the hand and led him to another seat in the
garden. Alone with the English gentleman the Sikh
ruler opened out his heart to him. He was concerned,
he said, to learn that the British authorities at Peshawur
were making no progress in their negotiations for the
purchase of a safe passage through the Khybur, and were
disinclined to accept the offers of the old Barukzye
Governor of Peshawur, Sultan Mahomed, who had declared
his willingness to “divide, scatter, and make terms with”
our enemies. He apprehended that there would be much
fighting and much slaughter; and it was only too probable
that the Sikh troops at Peshawur, seeing clearly the
danger of the movement, and not by any means understanding
the advantages that would accrue to them from
it, would refuse to enter the pass. Or if they entered it,
it was probable that they would suffer severely at the
hands of the Afghans&mdash;and in either case, as he had been
continually writing to Peshawur to impress upon the
officers there the necessity of effective co-operation with
the British, the odium would descend upon him, and
perhaps cost him his throne. It was easier to listen to
all this than to reply to it. Clerk saw as plainly as the
Maharajah himself, that as the Sikh troops had always
evinced an insuperable repugnance to enter the Khybur
Pass, even when the glory of the Khalsa was to be
advanced by the movement, and the dominions of the Lahore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Government to be extended, it was hardly reasonable to
expect them to show greater alacrity in the advancement of
the objects of another nation whom they cordially detested,
and whose disasters they regarded with secret delight.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>But whilst Shere Singh was thus expressing his misgivings
at Lahore, and the British agent was inwardly
acknowledging the reasonable character of the Maharajah’s
doubts, the Sikh troops at Peshawur were settling
down into a state of quiet obedience, and making up
their minds to penetrate the Khybur Pass. The letters
despatched by Shere Singh and his minister to Avitabile
and Gholab Singh had not been without their effect. A
confidential friend and adviser of the Sikh ruler&mdash;Boodh
Singh&mdash;had arrived at Peshawur, charged with messages
from the King and the minister, which were supposed to
have had an effect upon the Jummoo Rajah, sudden and
great. Lawrence, too, had been busy in the Sikh camp,
and little anticipating the circumstances under which it
was decreed that they should one day meet in that lovely
province of the old Douranee Empire over which the
Jummoo Rajah since exercised undisputed dominion, had
been holding long conferences with Gholab Singh.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
good tact, good temper, and quiet firmness of General
Pollock, had been exercised with the best results, and the
arrival of further reinforcements of European troops had
done much to give new confidence to the Khalsa. And
so it happened, that when General Pollock prepared to
enter the Khybur Pass, the Sikh troops had resolved not
to suffer their faces to be blackened before all India; and
really, when the hour for exertion came, did more for the
honour of their own arms and the support of the British
Government than the most sanguine of our officers had
ventured to expect.</p>

<p>The dragoons and the horse artillery reached Peshawur
on the 29th of March, and Pollock at once made his preparations
to enter the Khybur Pass. On the 31st he
pitched his camp at Jumrood, in the expectation of
advancing on the following morning; but new elements
of delay arose. The camel-drivers were deserting. Gholab
Singh had not moved up his camp. And, above all, the
rain was descending in floods. It would have dispirited
the troops to have moved them forward at such a time
and rendered more difficult the advance of the baggage.
Pollock had done his best to diminish to the least possible
amount the number of carriage-cattle that were to move
with him into the Khybur Pass. But an Indian commander
has no more difficult duty than this. Under no
circumstances is the general addiction to much baggage
very easily overcome. Men are not readily persuaded to
leave their comforts behind them. A fine soldierly appeal
was issued to the army;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and men of all ranks felt that it
came from an officer who was not less ready to make
sacrifices himself than to call upon others to make them.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Circumstances, too, at this time, tended to reduce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
amount of the baggage. The camel-drivers had deserted
in such numbers, that there was not even sufficient carriage
for the ammunition. The 33rd Regiment, which
had just arrived at Peshawur, could not come up to the
encamping-ground for want of cattle; and another day’s
halt was the result of the delay.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In the meanwhile, the
Sepoys were deserting from Wild’s Brigade; and no satisfactory
progress was making in the negotiations which
Mackeson had been carrying on for the purchase of a free
passage through the Khybur from the Afreedi Maliks.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
But there was one advantage in the delay. It gave time
for the Sikh troops to prepare themselves, after their own
fashion, to co-operate with our army, and General Pollock
felt that whatever might be the amount of active assistance
to be derived from the efforts of our allies, a combined
movement would have a good moral effect.</p>

<p>The order of march was now laid down, and was well
studied by commanding officers. Brigadier Wild was to
command the advance guard, and General M’Caskill the
rear. At the head of the column were to march the
grenadier company of the 9th Queen’s Regiment, one
company of the 26th Native Infantry, three companies of
the 30th Native Infantry, and two companies of the 33rd
Native Infantry, under Major Barnewell, of the 9th.
Then were to follow the Sappers and Miners, nine pieces
of artillery,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and two squadrons of the 3rd Dragoons.
After these, the camels, laden with all the treasure of the
force and a large portion of ammunition, were to move
on, followed by a squadron of the 1st Native Cavalry.
Then the Commissariat stores, protected by two companies
of the 53rd Native Infantry, were to advance, and a
squadron of the 1st Cavalry were to follow. Then the
baggage and camp-followers, covered by a Ressalah of
Irregular Horse, and a squadron of the 1st Native Cavalry,
were to move forward, with a further supply of ammunition,
and litters, and camel-panniers for the sick.</p>

<p>The rear-guard was to consist of three foot-artillery
guns&mdash;the 10th Light Cavalry&mdash;two Ressalahs of Irregular
Horse&mdash;two squadrons of the 3rd Dragoons&mdash;two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
horse-artillery guns&mdash;three companies of the 60th Native
Infantry; one company of the 6th Native Infantry; and
one company of her Majesty’s 9th Foot.</p>

<p>These details formed the centre column which was to
make its way through the pass. Two other columns, composed
entirely of infantry, were told off into parties, and
instructed to crown the heights on either side of the pass.
Two companies of her Majesty’s 9th Foot, four companies
of the 26th Native Infantry, with 400 jezailchees, were
placed under the command of Colonel Taylor, of the 9th
Foot; seven companies of the 30th Native Infantry,
under Major Payne; three companies of the 60th Native
Infantry, under Captain Riddle; four companies of the 64th
Native Infantry, under Major Anderson, with some details
of Broadfoot’s sappers, and a company and a half of her
Majesty’s 9th Foot; the party being commanded by Major
Davis, of the 9th, made up the right crowning column.</p>

<p>The left crowning column was to consist of two companies
of her Majesty’s 9th Foot, four companies of the
26th Native Infantry, and 200 jezailchees, under Major
Huish, of the 26th Native Infantry; seven companies of
the 53rd Native Infantry, under Major Hoggan, of that
corps; three companies of the 60th Native Infantry,
under Captain Napleton, of that regiment; and four and
a half companies of the 64th Native Infantry, and one
and a half companies of her Majesty’s 9th Foot, under
Colonel Moseley, of the 64th. With these last were to go
some auxiliaries, supplied by Torabaz Khan, the loyal
chief of Lalpoorah. The flanking parties were to advance
in successive detachments of two companies, at intervals
of 500 yards.</p>

<p>The order of march having been thus arranged and
judicious rules laid down for the guidance of commanding
officers,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Pollock marched his force to Jumrood. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
4th of April, whilst the troops were encamped at that
place, he issued further and more specific orders to regulate
the movements of the following morning. In the
evening, the General went round to all his commanding
officers to ascertain that they thoroughly understood the
orders that had been issued for their guidance; and to
learn from them what was the temper of their men.
There did not seem to be much cause for inquietude on
this score. The <i>morale</i> of the Sepoys had greatly improved.</p>

<p>At three o’clock on the morning of the 5th of April
the army commenced its march. It moved off in the
dim twilight, without beat of drum or sound of bugle.
Quietly the crowning columns prepared to ascend. The
heights on either side were covered with the enemy, but
so little was the mode of attack, which the British General
had determined upon, expected by the enemy, that it was
not until our flankers had achieved a considerable ascent
that the Khyburees were aware of their advance. Then,
as the morning dawned, the positions of the two forces
were clearly revealed to each other; and the struggle
commenced.</p>

<p>Across the mouth of the pass the enemy had thrown
up a formidable barrier. It was made of mud, and huge
stones, and heavy branches of trees. The Khyburees
had not wanted time to mature their defensive operations;
and they had thrown up a barricade of considerable
strength. It was not a work upon which our guns could
play with any good effect; but it was a small matter
effectually to destroy the barrier when once our light
infantry had swept the hills. And that work was soon
going on gallantly and successfully on both sides, whilst
the centre column, drawn up in battle-array, was waiting
the issue of the contest. Nothing could have proved
better than the arrangements of the General; and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
General could have wished his plan of attack to be carried
out with better effect. On the left, the crowning column
was soon in vigorous and successful action. On the right,
the precipitous nature of the ground was such that it
seemed to defy the eager activity of Taylor and his men.
But he stole round the base of the mountain unseen, and
found a more practicable ascent than that which he had
first tried. Then on both sides the British infantry were
soon hotly engaged with the mountaineers, clambering
up the precipitous peaks, and pouring down a hot and
destructive fire upon the surprised and disconcerted
Khyburees. They had not expected that our disciplined
troops, who had, as it were, been looking at the Khybur
for some months, would be more than a match for them
upon their native hills. But so it was. Our British
infantry were beating them in every direction, and everywhere
the white dresses of the Khyburees were seen flying
across the hills. The Duke of Wellington had said,
some time before, that he “had never heard that our
troops were not equal, as well in their personal activity as
by their arms, to contend with and overcome any natives
of hills whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And now our British infantry and
our Bengal Sepoys were showing how well able they were
to meet the Khyburees on their native hills. The mountain-rangers,
whom Macnaghten wished to raise, because
Sale’s brigade had been harassed by the Ghilzyes, could
not have clambered over the hills with greater activity
than our British troops, and would not have been half as
steady or half as faithful.</p>

<p>It was now time for Pollock to advance. The centre
column did not attempt to move forward until the
flankers had fought their way to the rear of the mouth
of the pass. But when he had fairly turned the enemy’s
position, he began to destroy the barrier, and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to advance into the pass. The enemy had assembled in
large numbers at the mouth, but finding themselves outflanked&mdash;finding
that they had to deal with different men
and a different system from that which they had seen a
few months before, they gradually withdrew, and, without
opposition, Pollock now cleared his way through the
barricade, and pushed into the pass with his long string
of baggage. The difficulties of the remainder of the
march were now mainly occasioned by the great extent of
this convoy. Pollock was conveying both ammunition
and provisions to Sale’s garrison; and there were many
more beasts of burden, therefore, than were used by his
own force. But skilfully was the march conducted. Encumbered
as he was, the General was compelled to move
slowly forward. The march to Ali-Musjid occupied the
greater part of the day. The heat was intense. The
troops suffered greatly from thirst. But they all did their
duty well. Whatever doubts may have lingered to the
last in Pollock’s mind, were now wholly dispersed; and
when he reached Ali-Musjid in safety, and had time to
think over the events of the day, nothing refreshed him
more than the thought that the Sepoys had fairly won
back the reputation they had lately lost.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The enemy had evacuated Ali-Musjid in the morning,
and now Ferris’s jezailchees were sent in to garrison the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
place. A part of Pollock’s force, with the head-quarters,
bivouacked near the fortress. The night was bitterly
cold; but the command of the heights was maintained,
and the men, both European and Natives, who had been
under arms since three o’clock in the morning, did not
utter a complaint. They appeared to feel that they
had done a great work; but that the utmost vigilance
was necessary to secure the advantage they had gained.
The enemy were still hovering about, and all night long
firing upon our people. It was necessary to be on the
alert.</p>

<p>It was a great thing to have accomplished such a march
with so little loss of life, and no loss of baggage. Avitabile
said that Pollock and his force were going to certain
destruction. Had he moved precipitately with his main
column into the pass, he would probably have been
driven back with great slaughter; but the precaution
he took in crowning the heights and turning the enemy’s
position, secured him, though not without some fighting
the whole way, a safe passage. The enemy are said
to have lost about 300 men killed, and 600 or 800
wounded.</p>

<p>The Sikh troops moved up by another pass to Ali-Musjid.
Pollock, still doubtful of their fidelity, and not
desiring to have them too near his own troops, suggested
that when he pushed forward by the Shadee-Bagiaree
Pass, they should take the other, known as the Jubogee.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Pollock had entered into a covenant with Gholab Singh
for the occupation of the pass by the Sikh troops until
the 5th of June. It was necessary that he should keep
open his communications with the rear; and the Sikhs
undertook to do it. But when Pollock marched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Jellalabad, they began to bargain with certain Afreedi
chiefs, hostile to our interests, to keep open the pass for
the stipulated time, for a certain sum of money, thus
making known to the tribes the time for which they had
covenanted to hold it.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Early in May the Sikhs suddenly
quitted their position at Ali-Musjid and returned to
Jumrood, seizing some of our baggage-cattle on the way,
throwing their loads on the ground, and employing the
animals to carry their baggage.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean while, Pollock had reached Jellalabad.
“We found the fort strong,” he wrote to a friend; “the
garrison healthy; and, except for wine and beer, better
off than we are. They were, of course, delighted to see
us. We gave three cheers as we passed the colours;
and the band of each regiment played as it came up. It
was a sight worth seeing. All appeared happy.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It
was, indeed, a happy meeting. Sale’s little garrison had
been shut up for five months in Jellalabad. They had
long been surrounded with perils, lessened only by their
own daring. They had looked in vain for succours,
until they became so familiar with danger that they
had begun to feel secure in the midst of it. But they
were weary of their isolation, and were eager to see
their countrymen again. Right welcome, therefore, was the
arrival of Pollock’s force; and happy the day on which
it appeared with streaming colours and gay music. But
the prospects of the garrison had brightened; and if
Pollock had to speak of his victories, Sale, too, had his to
narrate.</p>

<p>Pollock, before he entered the pass, had received intelligence
of the gallant sortie made by the garrison on the
1st of April, when they swept away from the covering
parties of the enemy a flock of 500 sheep and goats, which
had secured them a further ten days’ supply of meat.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Writing of this to General Pollock, Macgregor had said:
“Our troops of all arms are in the highest pluck, and they
seem never so happy as when fighting with the enemy.
I verily believe we could capture Mahomed Akbar’s camp,
even with our present means, were it our game to incur
the risk of an attempt of the kind.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This was lightly
spoken; a mere outburst of the abundant animal spirits
of the writer; but Pollock was scarcely on the other side
of Ali-Musjid, when he received tidings which made it
clear to him that now the light word had become a grave
fact, and the capture of Mahomed Akbar’s camp had been
actually accomplished.</p>

<p>And now that they had reached Jellalabad, every one in
Pollock’s camp was eager for details of this great victory.
It was, indeed, a dashing exploit. On the 5th of April,
Macgregor’s spies brought in tidings from Akbar Khan’s
camp that Pollock had been beaten back, with great
slaughter, in the Khybur Pass. On the morning of the
6th, the Sirdar’s guns broke out into a royal salute, in
honour of the supposed victory. Other reports then came
welling in to Jellalabad. It was said that there was
another revolution at Caubul, and that the Sirdar was
about to break up his camp and hasten to the capital.
In either case, it seemed that the time had come to strike
a blow at Akbar Khan’s army; so a council of war was
held, and the question gravely debated. It is said that
councils of war “never fight.” But the council which
now assembled to determine whether the Sirdar’s camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
should be attacked on the following morning, decided the
question in the affirmative. Unsurpassed in personal
courage by any daring youth in his camp, and ever eager
to fight under another man’s command, Sale sometimes
shrunk from energetic action when it brought down upon
him a burden of responsibility. But Havelock was at his
elbow&mdash;a man of rare coolness and consummate judgment,
with military talents of a high order, ripened by experience,
and an intrepidity in action not exceeded by that of
his fighting commander. He it was who, supported by
other zealous spirits, urged the expediency of an attack on
the enemy’s position, and laid down the plan of operations
most likely to ensure success. Sale yielded with reluctance&mdash;but
he did yield; and it was determined that at
daybreak on the following morning they should go out
and fight.</p>

<p>Sale issued directions for the formation of three columns
of infantry, the centre consisting of her Majesty’s 13th
Light Infantry, mustering 500 bayonets, under Colonel
Dennie; the left, under Lieutenant-Colonel Monteith,
C.B.; and the right, composed of one company of the
13th Light Infantry and one of the 35th Native Infantry,
and the detachment of Sappers, under Lieutenant Orr
(the severity of Captain Broadfoot’s wound still rendering
him non-effective), the whole amounting to 360 men,
commanded by Captain Havelock, of her Majesty’s 13th
Light Infantry. These were to be supported by the fire
of the guns of No. 6, Light Field Battery, under Captain
Abbott, to which Captain Backhouse, of Shah Soojah’s
Artillery, was attached, and by the whole of the small
cavalry force under Captain Oldfield and Lieutenant
Mayne.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Such were the components of the little force
that was to attack the camp of the Sirdar.</p>

<p>At daybreak they moved out of the fort by the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
gate. Akbar Khan was ready to receive them. He had
drawn out his troops before the camp, with his right
resting on a fort, and his left on the Caubul river. He
had not less than 6000 men. The plan of action proposed
by Havelock was, that they should make a sudden and
vigorous onslaught on the Sirdar’s camp and drive him
into the river, which at that time was a rapid and unfordable
torrent. But, abandoning this simple device, Sale, on
issuing from the gate, ordered Dennie forward to attack a
small fort, several hundred yards to the right, from which
the enemy had often molested us before, and in which
they were now strongly posted. Gallantly, at the head of
his men, went Dennie to the attack&mdash;a brave and chivalrous
soldier ever in the advance&mdash;but an Afghan marksman
covered him with his piece, and the ball passed
through Dennie’s body.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The movement was a false one;
it cost us the life of this good soldier, and well nigh lost
us the battle. The force being thus divided, the Afghan
horsemen came down impetuously on Havelock’s weak
infantry column; and if he had not persuaded the General
to recall the 13th from the fort, the action might have had
a different result. The recall was not too late. Sale now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
gave his orders for a general attack on the Sirdar’s camp;
and his orders were carried into effect with an impetuosity
and success worthy of the defenders of Jellalabad. In
the forcible language of the General’s despatch, on which I
cannot improve, “The artillery advanced at the gallop, and
directed a heavy fire upon the Afghan centre, whilst two
of the columns of infantry penetrated the line near the
same point, and the third forced back its left from its
support on the river, into the stream of which some of
his horse and foot were driven. The Afghans made repeated
attempts to check our advance by a smart fire of
musketry, by throwing forward heavy bodies of horse,
which twice threatened the detachments of foot under
Captain Havelock, and by opening upon us three guns
from a battery screened by a garden wall, and said to
have been served under the personal superintendence of
the Sirdar. But in a short time they were dislodged from
every point of their position, their cannon taken, and their
camp involved in a general conflagration. The battle was
over&mdash;and the enemy in full retreat in the direction of
Lughman by about 7 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> We have made ourselves
masters of two cavalry standards, recaptured four guns
lost by the Caubul and Gundamuck forces, the restoration
of which, to our government, is matter of much honest
exultation among our troops, seized and destroyed a great
quantity of materiel and ordnance stores, and burnt the
whole of the enemy’s tents. In short, the defeat of
Mahomed Akbar in open field, by the troops whom he
had boasted of blockading, has been complete and signal.”
Although our cavalry were not stopped in pursuit, as some
held they might have been with advantage, the enemy’s
loss was severe. “The field of battle was strewed with
the bodies of men and horses, and the richness of the
trappings of some of the latter seemed to attest that
persons of distinction had been among the casualties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>”
The loss on our side was small. Eight privates of the
13th Native Infantry, and two of the 35th Native Infantry,
were killed. Three officers and about fifty men
were wounded.</p>

<p>Great was the joy which the intelligence of the victories
of Pollock and Sale diffused throughout all India; and in
no one breast did so much of gladness bubble up as in
that of Lord Ellenborough. He wrote, that although it
was his misfortune not to be a soldier by profession, he
knew how to appreciate soldierly qualities and soldierly
acts. It was then that, being at Benares at the time, he
issued that well-known notification which conferred on
Sale’s brigade the honourable title by which it has since
been so well known&mdash;the title of the “Illustrious Garrison.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
That garrison had now done its work, and taken
its place in history. Sale ceased to command at Jellalabad;
and soon letters from Lord Ellenborough set aside
the political functions of Macgregor. In Pollock and
Nott, on either side of Afghanistan, had been vested
supreme political authority; and Macgregor soon took his
place beside the General, simply as his <i>aide-de-camp</i>. By
Pollock’s side, too, holding the office of his military secretary,
was Shakespear, who had done such good service in
liberating the Russian slaves at Khiva; who had won his
spurs by this Central-Asian exploit, and returned to India
Sir Richmond Shakespear. Pollock knew the worth of
these men, and turned their experience to account. But
the reign of the “Politicals” was at an end. Lord Ellenborough
had determined to dethrone them.</p>

<p>The Governor-General knew his men. He did well
in trusting Pollock and Nott. But after the melancholy
illustration of the trustworthiness of military officers of
high rank displayed in the conduct of affairs at Caubul,
the time hardly seemed a happy one for opening out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
question of political and military responsibilities, and
their relative effects upon the interests of the state. It is
right, however, now that it has been stated how the whole
system, which exercised so great an influence over events
in Afghanistan, was abolished by the Governor-General,
that something should be said upon the general character
of the diplomatic functionaries employed on the great
field of Central Asia.</p>

<p>There is no single controversial topic which has struck
out so many sparks of bad feeling&mdash;so much personality,
so much bitter invective, and I fear it must be added, so
much reckless mendacity, as this question of political
agency. At one time a “Political” was, by many
writers, considered fair game. To hunt him down with
all conceivable calumny and vituperation, was regarded
as a laudable achievement. Every one had a stone to
throw at him&mdash;every one howled at him with execration,
or shouted at him in derision. Temperate men on this
topic, became intemperate; charitable men, uncharitable;
sagacity ceased to be sagacious; discrimination ceased to
discriminate. All alike lifted up their voices to swell the
chorus of popular indignation.</p>

<p>The Caubul outburst, with its attendant horrors, filled
this cup of bitter feeling to the brim. It would be difficult
to embody, in a page of mere description, the popular
notion of an Afghan “Political.” He was believed to be
a very conceited, a very arrogant, a very ignorant, and
a very unfeeling personage; a pretender, who, on the
strength of a little smattering of Persian and some
interest, perhaps petticoat interest, in high places, had
obtained an appointment, the duties of which he was
not capable of performing, and the trust involved in
which he was well-nigh certain to abuse. He was looked
upon as a creature whose blunders were as mischievous as
his pretensions were ridiculous; one, whose ideas of diplomacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
were limited to the cultivation of a moustache and
the faculty of sitting cross-legged on the ground; who
talked largely about Durbar, rode out with a number of
Sowars at his heels; and was always on the point of
capturing some fugitive chief, and never achieving it after
all. But this was only the more favourable aspect of the
picture. There was another and a darker side. He was
sometimes represented as a roaring lion, going about
seeking whom he should devour; unveiling Afghan ladies
and pulling Afghan gentlemen by the beard; inviting
chiefs to a conference and then betraying them; blowing
Sirdars from guns; conniving at wholesale massacre;
bribing brothers to betray brothers, fathers their sons;
keeping fierce dogs to hound them at innocent countrymen;
desecrating mosques, insulting Moollahs, trampling
on the Koran&mdash;in a word, committing every conceivable
outrage that cruelty and lust could devise. There was no
amount of baseness, indeed, of which these men were not
supposed to be capable; no licentiousness to which they
were not addicted; no crimes which they did not commit.
This was the popular notion of an “Afghan Political.”
It was constantly illustrated in oral conversation and in
the local literature of the day. Men talked and wrote
upon the subject as though the question&mdash;if ever question
there were&mdash;had long ago been settled by common consent;
and it was not until the war had been brought to a
close, that a doubt was raised respecting the validity of
the charges so generally brought against the Ishmaels of
diplomacy in the East.</p>

<p>Very much of this is now mere exploded slander. I
cannot say that the political officers, who distinguished
themselves throughout the Afghanistan campaign, have
<i>lived down</i> the calumny of which they were the victims.
Very few of the number survive. But a reaction, in public
opinion, is discernible,&mdash;a growing disposition to do justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
at least to the memories of the dead. Men speak and
write more temperately on the subject. Exaggeration no
longer over-strides all our utterances on this topic; and, in
some cases, full justice has been done to the noble qualities
of head and heart which have adorned, perhaps do adorn
men amongst us, under the great “Political” reproach.</p>

<p>It would serve no good purpose to run from one
extreme into the other. It is the evil of sudden reactions
of popular feeling, that men escape from one error only to
be precipitated into another of an opposite class. The
system of political agency is not one of unmixed good;
nor are political agents exempt from the common frailties
of humanity. Many mistakes were unquestionably committed;
sometimes a stronger word might without exaggeration
have been applied to the things that were done
in Afghanistan by our diplomatic agents. Diplomacy is,
at all times, a dangerous game. It has seldom, if ever,
been played in any part of the world, without some loss of
purity, some departure from integrity. In Europe, the
diplomatist treads a tortuous path. Guile is met with
guile. Fraud is often counteracted by fraud. Minister
overreaches minister. One state jockeys another. And,
in the affairs of nations, arts are resorted to, which, in
the concerns of private life, would stamp the wily plotter
with infamy not to be escaped. But, in the East, in the
midst of the worst contagion, tempted on every side,
stimulated by the fear of failure, irritated by the duplicity
of others, far greater is the difficulty of preserving intact
the diplomatic integrity which is exposed to so many corrupting
influences. I am not asserting the propriety of
fighting all men with their own weapons. I have no faith
whatever in the worldly wisdom, apart from all considerations
of right and wrong, of playing off wile against wile&mdash;meeting
treachery with treachery&mdash;lie with lie. Such
tactics may succeed for a season; but, in the long run,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
truth and honesty will be found the most effective
weapons. All I desire to plead in behalf of our Oriental
diplomatists is the extraordinary temptations to which
they have been exposed. Many of them were necessarily
without experience in the difficult game; and, therefore,
apprehensive of failure&mdash;little confident in themselves,
when called upon to encounter, perhaps for the first time,
the deep duplicity of Eastern intrigue. Fearful of being
drawn into a snare, and deeply impressed with a sense of
the responsibilities resting upon them, they have sometimes,
in their eagerness to bring negotiations to a successful
issue, departed from that strict line of integrity,
which we could wish our countrymen ever to maintain.
This much at least must be admitted&mdash;but who has ever
gained a reputation as a skilful diplomatist without some
deviation from the straight path of open and truthful
manliness of conduct?</p>

<p>“If a man is too stupid or too lazy to drill his company,”
wrote General Nott, “he often turns sycophant, cringer to
the heads of departments, and is made a ‘Political,’ and
of course puts the government to an enormous expense,
and disgraces the character of his country.” Nothing was
ever more unlike the truth. The Afghan “Politicals”
were among the best soldiers in the country. Many of
them, as Todd, Rawlinson, Nicolson, &amp;c., were practised
drill-instructors and had shown an especial fitness for this
particular duty in disciplining foreign troops or raw levies.
And no one, who takes account of the most honourable
incidents of the Afghan War, will overlook the military
services rendered by Pottinger, Macgregor, H. M. Lawrence,
Mackeson, Broadfoot, Outram, and others, who
are known to us as Political Agents. There have been no
finer soldiers in the Indian Army than some of those
who distinguished themselves during the war in Afghanistan,
under the unpopular designation of “Politicals.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[January-April: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Last Days of Shah Soojah&mdash;State of Parties at Caubul&mdash;Condition
of the Hostages&mdash;the Newab Zemaun Khan&mdash;Letters of Shah
Soojah&mdash;His Death&mdash;Question of his Fidelity&mdash;His Character and
Conduct considered.</p>

<p><span class="beg">It</span> is time that I should pause in the narration of the
retributory measures of the British-Indian Government,
to dwell, for a little space, upon the events at Caubul
which succeeded the departure of Elphinstone’s army. It
had been rumoured throughout India&mdash;and the rumour
had created no little astonishment in the minds of those
who had believed that the Caubul insurrection was a
movement against the Feringhees and the King&mdash;that
ever since the departure of the former Shah Soojah had
continued to occupy the Balla Hissar, and had been recognised
as the supreme authority by the very men who
had recently been in arms against him. And the rumour
was a perfect echo of the truth. Ever since the departure
of the British army Shah Soojah had reigned at
Caubul.</p>

<p>He had reigned at Caubul, but he had not ruled. His
power was merely nominal. The chiefs wanted a puppet;
and in the unhappy Shah they found the only one
who was ever likely to stand between them and the
vengeance of the British nation. Day after day they
made their salaam to him in the Balla Hissar; but so
imperfect even was their outward recognition of his regal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
dignity, that money was still coined in the name of the
Newab Zemaun Khan. The Newab, who had been raised
to the sovereignty by the voice of the chiefs soon after
the first outbreak of the insurrection, had cheerfully resigned
the honour that had been thrust upon him, and
accepted the office of Wuzeer. Ameen-oollah Khan was
appointed Naib, or deputy. For a little time there was
some outward show of harmony; but there was no real
union between the King and the chiefs. The Barukzyes
spoke scornfully of the King; and the King could not
refrain from expressing his mistrust of the whole tribe of
Barukzyes. Ameen-oollah Khan, openly swearing allegiance
to both, seems to have held the balance between
the two opposing factions, and was in reality the most
influential man in the state. He had amassed, by fraud
and violence, large sums of money, which the other chiefs,
straitened as they were by an empty treasury, and unable
to carry out any great national measure, would fain have
made him disgorge. From the Shah himself they contrived
to extort some three or four lakhs of rupees; but
when Akbar Khan wrote pressing letters to Caubul for
guns and ammunition, that he might lay siege to Jellalabad,
no one would move without pay, and money was not
forthcoming.</p>

<p>All parties were jealous of each other; and especially
jealous of the rising power of Akbar Khan. The young
Barukzye was in Lughman; and the elder chiefs at Caubul,
even if they had possessed the money to enable them
to answer these emergent indents upon their military
resources, would have been little inclined to send him the
reinforcements and munitions for which he was continually
writing. They talked about raising an army of their
own, and opposing the retributory march of the British
through the Khybur Pass; but the want of money presented
an insuperable obstacle to any military movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on a scale that would afford a prospect of success. The
Shah himself talked openly in Durbar about standing
forward as defender of the faith, and declaring a religious
war against the Kaffirs; but he privately assured Conolly
that he was heart and soul with the British, and he wrote
long letters to the Governor-General, Clerk, Macgregor,
and others, declaring his inviolable fidelity, and eagerly
clamouring for money.</p>

<p>In the mean while the English hostages remained under
the protection of Mahomed Zemaun Khan. Nothing
could exceed the kindness of the good old man. Faithful
among the faithless, he was resolute to defend the Christian
strangers at all risks; and never, when the popular
clamour ran highest, and other men of note were thirsting
for the blood of the captives, did he waver for an instant
in his determination to shield the helpless Feringhees
from the malice of his remorseless countrymen. He was
a Barukzye chief&mdash;a near relative of Dost Mahomed
Khan; and there was not among the Sirdars of all the
tribes one in whom the spirit of nationality glowed more
strongly and more purely. But whilst the independence
of his country was as dear to him as to any of his brethren,
he did not burn with that fierce hatred against the
English which broke out in other places, nor did he ever,
in the advancement of the most cherished objects of his
heart, stain his patriotism with those foul crimes from
which elsewhere there was little shrinking. Regarding
with abhorrence the conduct of those who had betrayed
our unhappy people, he himself did all that, single-handed,
he could do, to atone for the cruelty of his countrymen;
and no father could have treated his children more kindly
than the good Newab cherished and protected the English
hostages who found a sanctuary in his house.</p>

<p>But it was necessary, whilst the excitement ran so high
at Caubul, and there was a prospect of violent contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
among the chiefs, to do something more than this.
Ameen-oollah Khan never slackened in his exertions to
obtain possession of the persons of the hostages. Having
tried every kind of stratagem, and failed to secure them
by fraud, he would have resorted to open violence. It
was necessary, therefore, to oppose force to force; so the
Newab raised an army of his own. His pecuniary resources
were limited; but he did not hesitate to spend his
little store freely in entertaining followers. Mainly for
the protection of the English gentlemen he raised a body
of 1000 footmen, whom he armed with English bayonets;
another body of 1000 horse, and some Jezailchees&mdash;in
all, about 3000 men. The English guns, too, were in his
possession, and he refused to yield them up to the Shah.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The King regarded his proceedings with mistrust.
There was no sort of cordiality between them. The old
Suddozye and Barukzye strife seemed about to be renewed
with all its pristine vigour. At last the Shah, about the
middle of the month of March, corrupted the commandant
of the Newab’s army, who went over with all his followers
to the Balla Hissar. This event, which threatened entirely
to change the state of parties at the capital, threw
all Caubul into a ferment. The shops were closed; the
people began to arm themselves. The Newab demanded
the restoration of his troops; but the King only yielded
a conditional assent. He appears at this time to have
been entirely in the hands of Ameen-oollah Khan; and
he replied, that if the hostages were sent to the house of
the Loghur chief, the recreant commandant should be sent
there at the same time. The Newab, however, resolutely
refused to give up the English gentlemen. The proposal
seems to have strengthened Conolly’s suspicions of the
fidelity of Shah Soojah. It nearly cost the hostages their
lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It now seemed that Caubul was about to become the
theatre of internecine strife. The gates of the Balla
Hissar were half closed, and the Shah never ventured
beyond them. The chiefs were all mustering retainers.
The King was endeavouring to cast suspicion on the
nationality of the Newab; and the Newab’s party were
doubting the fidelity of the King. The Populzye leaders
of the insurrection clustered round the monarch, but he
had neither popularity nor power. Money he had; but
making an outward show of poverty, he resolutely refused
to produce it; and the people began to abuse him for his
parsimony. In this conjuncture he continued to write to
the British authorities, declaring that he could do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for them if they would only send him money; but
the British authorities were deaf to his entreaties, and
only sent him advice.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>But the difficulties of the Shah were now drawing to a
close; his days were numbered. Whilst he was awaiting
the receipt of answers to his letters, the excitement in
Caubul was increasing&mdash;the division among the chiefs was
becoming more and more irreconcilable. Horribly perplexed
and bewildered, anxious at once to appear in the
eyes of his countrymen true to the national cause, and to
retain the good-will of the English by some show of
fidelity to them, he fell into every kind of inconsistency,
was suspected by both parties, and either way was rushing
on destruction. At last the chiefs called upon him to
prove his sincerity by placing himself at the head of all
the available troops, and marching down upon Jellalabad.
The Shah yielded a reluctant consent; and, on the 29th
of March sent round his criers to proclaim that he was
about to march southward on the 31st; that the chiefs
were to accompany him, and to send out their tents on
the preceding day. The summons was scantily obeyed.
The Kuzzilbash chief declared that as neither the King
nor the minister had supplied him with money, he could
not move. The King said that he had no confidence in
the chiefs, and that, therefore, he would not go, but that
Ameen-oollah might go for him. And so the expedition
was postponed. In the mean while, Akbar Khan was
writing urgent letters to Caubul clamouring for reinforcements,
and urging that it was wretched policy to be
eternally at variance with one another&mdash;quarrelling for
money and quarrelling for rank&mdash;instead of making
common cause against the hated Feringhees.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>After a pause of a few days the King again consented
to march. His suspicion of the Barukzyes, however, was
not easily to be allayed. Nor was it wholly without
reason. Even impartial lookers-on prophesied that if he
left Caubul he would either be murdered or blinded by
the Barukzyes.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Aware of these suspicions, the Newab
sent his wife to Shah Soojah with a sealed Koran, assuring
the King with a solemn oath that the Barukzyes and
other chiefs would be true to him. Fortified by this
assurance, the Shah moved out of the Balla Hissar on the
4th of April, but before nightfall returned to the palace,
determined on the following morning to review his troops
and then to start for Jellalabad. Rising early on the
morning of the 5th, he arrayed himself in royal apparel,
and, accompanied by a small party of Hindostanees,
proceeded under a salute, in a chair of state, towards his
camp, which had been pitched at Seeah-Sungh. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Soojah-ool-dowlah, the son of the Newab, had gone out
before him, and placed in ambush a party of Jezailchees.
As the Shah and his followers were making their way
towards the regal tent, the marksmen fired upon them.
The volley took murderous effect. Several of the bearers
and of the escort were struck down; and the King
himself killed on the spot. A ball had entered his brain.
Soojah-ool-dowlah then rode up; and as he contemplated
his bloody work, the body of the unhappy King, vain
and pompous as he was to the very last, was stripped of
all the jewels about it&mdash;the jewelled dagger, the jewelled
girdle, the jewelled head-dress; and it was then cast into
a ditch.</p>

<p>The news of the King’s murder spread like wildfire.
Great was the consternation. Futteh Jung, the second
son of the Shah, on receiving the sad tidings of his father’s
death, made with all speed towards the Balla Hissar; but
the gates were guarded; so he turned back and sought
refuge in the fort of Mahomed Khan, Bayat. That night
however, Mahomed Khan, in concert with Ameen-oollah,
who held the Balla Hissar, restored the Prince to the
palace; and they agreed to proclaim him King. The
body of Shah Soojah was recovered, and for some days
it lay in state. The royal family declared that until
sentence had been passed upon the murderer it should
not be buried. The Moollahs were assembled to expound
the punishment due to so atrocious an offender; and they
pronounced, on the authority of their religious books,
that the murderer of the King should be stoned to death.
But Ameen-oollah Khan interposed. He said that it was
not a time to carry out such a sentence; all parties
were bound to league themselves together to fight against
the Feringhees; and intestine animosities ought therefore
to be forgot.</p>

<p>To no one were the circumstances of the Shah’s death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a source of deeper horror and regret than to the good old
Newab, the father of the murderer. He is said to have
sworn an oath never again to see his son beneath his roof,
or to suffer him to be named in his presence.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Various
circumstances have been assigned as the proximate causes
of the murder of the unfortunate Shah. It was said that
he had drawn down upon himself the increased animosity
of the Barukzyes, by appointing to the command of the
army a son of Ameen-oollah Khan. Akbar Khan, too,
had recently been wounded by an accidental shot from a
Pesh-Khidmut, or attendant, which was said to have been
designed to take the life of the Sirdar; and it had been
rumoured that Shah Soojah had bribed the man to make
the murderous attempt. That the Newab Zemaun Khan
was not implicated in the foul transaction, all men are
willing to believe; but it was intended to strengthen the
party of which he was then the acknowledged chief. It
was the consummation of the great strife which for forty
years had been raging between Shah Soojah and the
Barukzye Sirdars. Indeed, it would have been little in
accordance with the general tenor of Afghan history if
this unfortunate Prince had not died a violent death.
After so eventful a life, it would have been strange indeed
if he had sunk to rest peaceably on his bed.</p>

<p>Among the obscurer points of Afghan history, there is
not one more obscure than that which involves the
question of the fidelity of Shah Soojah. That doubts
were cast upon his sincerity has been already shown.
Conscious of this, he entered upon a defence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
conduct in a series of letters to the British authorities
which I have now given to the world. Written hastily,
and under the influence of strong excitement, they carry
very little conviction with them. The main object of
these letters appears to have been the extraction of money
from the British treasury. The Shah continued to assert,
that having no money he had no power, but that if money
were sent to him he would be able to do great things
for his late allies. Death makes many revelations. The
death of Shah Soojah revealed the mendacity and the
avarice of the man. Some twenty lakhs of rupees, besides
jewels of large value, were found to have been in his
possession when he died.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This disagreeable circumstance,
though by no means conclusive against the general
fidelity of the Shah, certainly will not predispose
the inquirer to take an unduly favourable view of his
conduct.</p>

<p>It must, however, be always kept steadily in view, that
the circumstances of Shah Soojah’s position were such as
to surround him with an atmosphere of doubt and suspicion.
That the chiefs made use of the King’s name at
the outset of the insurrection, and produced an inflammatory
document said to bear the royal seal, is one of the
most notorious facts in the entire history of the war.
The seal was genuine, but the document was a supposititious
one. Nothing is more common, in times of popular
excitement, than for the Afghans to endeavour to injure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
one another by giving currency to forged instruments.
It was to the last degree improbable that, at this time,
Shah Soojah should have committed himself by putting
the seal to any documents which might have fallen into
the hands of his European allies, and laid bare the blackness
of his treachery. But that he would have been glad
to have cast off the Feringhee alliance, and to have ruled
without the restraint of our superintendence and interference,
is not to be questioned. He may, therefore, have
regarded with inward satisfaction the progress of the
insurrectionary movement, and rejoiced in its ultimate
success; but he does not appear to have been more than
a passive instrument in the hands of others. It was
obviously his policy to appear all things to all people.
He could not venture to take any decided course. He
never in the prime of life had been conspicuous for
manliness of character; and now, in his old age, he was
more than ever a waverer and a waiter upon fortune.
Perhaps, I should not err if I were to say that he was
true neither to his own countrymen nor to his British
allies. He was prepared to side with either the one or
the other, according to the direction in which the tide of
success might be seen to flow. He had no affection for
the English; but he dearly loved English money. He
knew the value of British aid; but he would fain have
had it from a distance. From the very first he had
disliked the obtrusive manner in which it had been forced
upon him. He wanted the <i>prestige</i> of British support
without the incumbrance of British control. To retain
our friendship, and yet to rid himself of our presence, was
unquestionably the desire of the Shah; but it is doubtful
whether his desire would ever have shaped itself into any
overt acts of hostility against the government which had
restored him to the throne of his fathers. He was not
deficent of gratitude, even if there had been anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
call it forth;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but he had sufficient sagacity to know that
his political existence was dependent upon the will of the
British Government. And he was cautious not to do
anything to provoke its vengeance. The chiefs believed,
at the commencement of the November outbreak, that
though the insurrection would soon be crushed, such a
manifestation of popular feeling would in all probability
cause the British authorities to tremble for the safety
of their position, and induce them to evacuate the
country in the ensuing spring. Encouraging a similar
belief, Shah Soojah may have regarded with inward satisfaction
the outbreak of the revolution. But he was surprised
and alarmed by the rapidity of its progress; and
was wholly unprepared for the sanguinary termination of
his connection with his Christian allies. That he was in a
state of painful depression and prostration throughout the
entire period of the insurrection is not to be questioned;
and it is scarcely less certain that he never wholly recovered
from the terror which then bewildered him. The
irruption culminated somewhat too violently for a man of
Shah Soojah’s temperament; and when he found what a
convulsion had been raised around him, he shrunk back
in dismay. On either side dangers and difficulties started
up in his path. He strove to save himself by doing little,
and being to all outward seeming the friend both of the
Afghan insurgents and their European foes. Duplicity is
never long successful. Doubted by both parties, the king
became an object of general contempt. He trimmed
between the two contending hosts, and escaped the rocks
on neither side of the vessel.</p>

<p>On such a question as this, it is right that the opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the leading political officers, who were best acquainted
with the character and the conduct of the Shah, and had
the best opportunities of investigating the circumstances
of the Caubul insurrection, should be summarily recorded.
“To my mind,” wrote Captain Mackeson to Mr. Clerk,
“there has ever appeared but little doubt that his Majesty
Shah Soojah was, in the commencement, the instigator of
the Caubul insurrection. Had the first blow struck by the
rebels been effectual, his Majesty might, perhaps, have
thrown off the mask earlier; but our troops in cantonments
held their position though surrounded by foes
without number, whilst those in the Balla Hissar held his
Majesty in check. Nay, the chances were at one time so
much in favour of our success, that his Majesty discarded
his own instruments, refusing all their solicitations to place
himself at their head. To such an extent did he carry
his reluctant adherence to us, that at length the rebels,
in their turn, were obliged to seek for a leader among
the Barukzyes. His Majesty then husbanded his own
resources, allowing the Barukzyes and our people to
fight out the battle. Sir William Macnaghten would
not have treated with Mahomed Akbar Khan had he
not been convinced of the treachery towards us of Shah
Soojah.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Captain Macgregor’s opinion coincides, but with some
amount of qualification, with that of the last witness. “I
agree with you” (Mackeson), he wrote, “in thinking
that the Shah was more or less implicated in the insurrection;
but when he saw that it took such a serious
turn, I really believe that he repented&mdash;even so soon as
he heard of Burnes’s assassination, and of the massacre of
the other officers in the city. His Majesty pressed Sir
William to remove all the British troops into the Balla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Hissar, which in itself looked like a friendly feeling
towards us.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The opinion of Major Rawlinson sets in an opposite
direction. It throws a side-light from Candahar on the
conduct of the Shah at this time. “From everything I
can learn, I should say that the Shah was certainly well
inclined to us; and, if assured of our again placing confidence
in him, would cordially support our advance. He
has certainly done as little as he could, keeping up
appearances with the Mussulman party, to complicate our
position at this place, and I learn that for some time past
the prevalent opinion in the Douranee camp has been
that the Shah desired our success.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Captain Mackenzie’s opinion, as to the conduct and
motives of the Shah, involves some considerations not
noticed by others: “The king highly esteemed and loved
Macnaghten personally, as indeed all the Afghans did
who came into direct intercourse with that accomplished
and courteous English gentleman. Macnaghten’s chivalrous
consideration for the proud but dependant monarch,
who felt his somewhat false position keenly, had been
unvarying and unremitting: perhaps more so than the
public interests warranted. But we can afford to admire
the high tone and delicacy of the envoy’s motives, especially
as few public functionaries are likely to be misled
by similar knightly scruples. The king more than once
openly discussed with Macnaghten the likelihood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
attempts to sow dissension between them, by the propagation
of reports of his want of faith towards his British
allies, and he always added: “You are yourself aware
that you are as necessary to me as my nails are to my
fingers.” Burnes was a man of totally different temperament
from Macnaghten, and his demeanour towards the
king was neither conciliatory nor deferential. It is not
saying too much, that the king hated him; he was aware
that his friend the Envoy was about to depart from
Caubul, thus leaving him in Burnes’s hands; and after a
careful consideration of the character of his proceedings
from first to last, of the nature of the motives by which
he was generally actuated (<i>i. e.</i> petty and personal), and
also of the opinion of many of the most intelligent Afghans,
the most probable conjecture is, that Shah Soojah
was aware of the plot and combination against himself
and the Feringhees before the outbreak; that he hoped
it would be sufficient to detain Macnaghten in the
country, but not enough to baffle our military power;
and that, when he became thoroughly alarmed on the
morning of the 2nd of November, he did his best to quell
the insurrection, and openly expressed his astonishment
and disappointment at the apathy and inefficiency of the
English leaders and their troops. He can scarcely, with due
consideration for the peculiarities of the Asiatic mind, and
the desperate circumstances of his position, be judged by
the European standard of honour and morality, if he subsequently
temporised with the dominant Barukzyes. He
well knew what he had to expect at their hands, and he
fully anticipated the fate which afterwards overtook him.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>But of all the officers connected with the British Mission,
John Conolly was the one who enjoyed the best
opportunities of arriving at a correct estimate of the conduct
of the Shah. During the insurrection he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
attendance on the king at the Balla Hissar, and he was
at Caubul up to the time of his death. Conolly’s opinions
are on record. He seems at one time to have entertained
the strongest possible conviction that the Shah was true
to his British allies. “I believe,” he wrote on the 17th
of January, “that he is heart and soul in our interest;
and it is contrary to all reason to suppose otherwise.”
But by the 15th of February his belief in the fidelity of
the Shah seems to have been shaken; for he wrote to
Macgregor: “It is generally believed and asserted
throughout the town that his Majesty instigated the
late rebellion. I have never been able to prove the
accusation, though I cannot but think that he was,
directly or indirectly, the cause of the revolution.” A
month afterwards, writing still more distinctly to General
Pollock, he cast further doubts on the fidelity of the
Shah. “I would suggest,” he said, “that some direct
understanding be come to with his Majesty. It is generally
believed that he caused the late rebellion; and his
conduct lately has been strange, to say the least of it.
He tried to raise a popular tumult against us, hoping
thereby to ruin the Newab. He did not interest himself
in any way about our sick when their wretched, helpless
condition was formally represented to him in a petition
from me&mdash;added to the circumstance alluded to of his
telling our host to send us to Ameen-oollah, who is our
most bitter enemy. He is, moreover, surrounded by the
Populzye leaders of the late insurrection, whose persons,
I presume, our government will demand. I have not
received a letter from him for a month; but the fear of
being suspected of being in communication with us may
be the cause of his disregard of us.” And again, at the
end of the month, writing to Major Rawlinson, he said:
“The king is generally abused, and reported as the instigator
of the late rebellion. He has proved himself, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
think, unworthy of our friendship. If we are not able to
prove his villany, his cunning will, no doubt, prompt him
to side with us on the near approach of our troops, for he
is well aware that his subjects would seize him if he ventured
out of the Balla Hissar. He is, as the Afghans
say, like grain between two mill-stones.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Many more passages might be cited from the correspondence
of our political officers, to show the opinions
entertained at this time by those most competent to
determine the question of the Shah’s fidelity. But, after
all, the question remains an open one. The future
historian may still lose himself in a sea of conjecture.
From the facts before us, and from all that is known of
the character of Shah Soojah, the inference is, as I have
said, that the king was faithful neither to his own
countrymen nor to his British allies. He was at best a
poor creature. He had few good qualities. But it should
in justice be remembered, that he was surrounded by
circumstances against which an abler and a better man
might have struggled in vain. He had long been greatly
perplexed and embarrassed by the anomalies of his position.
He was tired of playing the part of the puppet;
and had begun to long for an opportunity either of
becoming king indeed, or of throwing down the trappings
and the cares of royalty, and ending his days in the calm
security of his old asylum at Loodhianah. He used to
say that Macnaghten did all the good that was done in
Afghanistan&mdash;and all the evil too; for that he himself
did nothing. Unpopular measures of which he was not
the author were executed in his name; he was compelled
outwardly to sanction much of which he inwardly disapproved;
he saw dangers thickening around him without
the power of averting them, and painfully felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had always been a cipher, and had now become a hissing
and a reproach.</p>

<p>Under the directorship which we had forced upon him,
Shah Soojah was not happy. He was altogether a disappointed
man. He did not find the sweets of restored
dominion what he expected them to be. He was an
isolated being. The sympathies neither of the Afghans
nor of the English were with him. All men suspected him.
None loved him. When, therefore, he talked about leaving
Caubul, he was probably not insincere; but he may
have thought sometimes that if the English would leave
Caubul, he might enjoy his sovereignty more. If to have
desired to rid himself of an incubus, which sate so heavily
upon him, was to be faithless to the British, Shah Soojah
was unquestionably faithless; but this is a kind of infidelity
so common to humanity of all ranks and in all
places, that to record it against the Shah is only to say
that he was a man.</p>

<p>But as regards the actions of the King, it is to be
observed that Shah Soojah was not a man of action. His
early life had been one rather of strenuous passiveness
than of genuine activity. Since the British had taken
him in hand, he had actually done nothing. When
the insurrection burst over Caubul, he sate down and
waited. After the departure of the British, he sate down
and waited. He was afraid of both parties; and unwilling
to declare himself openly until he could clearly see how
the contest would end. He had not strength of mind sufficient
to keep him faithful to any one. He was not even
true to himself. The question is less a question of fact
than of character. The solution of the difficulty is to be
found in the idiosyncrasy of the man. He had led a very
eventful life; but the vicissitudes of his career had not
strengthened his character. Anything decided, active, or
energetic, was not to be expected from him. The infirmity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of age was now superadded to the infirmity of
purpose which had characterised his greener manhood;
and if he had taken any decided part in the great contest
which followed the outburst of the Caubul insurrection,
it would have been an inconsistency at variance with the
whole tenor of his past life. As it was, the conduct of
the man in this crisis was in keeping with all that was
known of his character and his antecedents. Shah Soojah
was not a hero; and he did not play a heroic part. The
British Government had picked him out of the dust of
Loodhianah, simply as a matter of convenience to themselves;
and they had no reason to complain that, in a
great and imminent conjuncture, he thought less of their
convenience than his own. He proved himself at the last
to be very much what we had helped to make him. We
could not expect him to be an active workman, when we
had so long used him as a tool.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> attention of the reader ought now no longer to be
withheld from that part of the country where General
Nott and Major Rawlinson were gallantly and successfully
holding out against the insurgent Douranees, and
maintaining the character of the British nation before
the tribes of Western Afghanistan. At the beginning of
November, wrote Rawlinson, in a summary of events,
drawn up with such masterly distinctness and comprehensiveness,
that the historian has little to do, in this
place, but to submit himself to its guidance;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> “affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wore a more tranquil and promising appearance in the
Candahar province than I had ever witnessed since my
assumption of the charge of the agency. Akram Khan,
the leader of the Derawat rebellion, captured by Lieutenant
Conolly, had been executed at this place by his
Majesty’s orders. Eight of the most influential of his
colleagues had been sent by me, according to the orders
of the Envoy, under the charge of Lieutenant Crawford,
to Caubul; that officer having my written instructions
to destroy his prisoners in the event of an attempt at
rescue. The Hazareh and the Belooch tribes had been
effectually conciliated; the Douranees of the northern
and western districts had been humbled and overawed.”</p>

<p>The troops then at Candahar consisted of her Majesty’s
40th Regiment; the 2nd, 16th, 38th, 40th, and 43rd
Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry; Captain Blood’s
battery (Bombay Artillery); the Shah’s Horse Artillery,
under Captain Anderson; some regiments of the Shah’s
infantry, and some detachments of Irregular Horse
(Shah’s and Skinner’s), the weakness of the force lying
in this arm. The tranquillity of the country seemed to
authorise the diminution of this force, and a brigade,
comprising the 16th, 42nd, and 43rd Regiments of
Bengal Native Infantry, was about to proceed, under
Colonel Maclaren, to the provinces of Hindostan. On
the 7th of November it commenced its march; but on
the evening of that day some startling intelligence was
brought into Candahar. A detachment of 130 men
under Captain Woodburn&mdash;that officer who, in the month
of July, had so distinguished himself on the banks of the
Helmund, in action with the Douranee rebels under
Akhtar Khan&mdash;was proceeding from Candahar to Caubul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
when, on the 2nd of November, after they had passed
Ghuznee, they were attacked by swarms of Afghans,
through whom, with consummate gallantry and skill,
Woodburn fought his way to the little fort of Syedabad.
The place was occupied by a man supposed to be friendly
to us;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and the English officer, surrounded as he was by
the enemy, gladly accepted his offer of protection. But
there was no safety within the fort. For a day and a
night he held his position against a besieging enemy, and
nobly he defended himself. But his ammunition fell short;
and then there came tidings of the success of the insurgents
at Caubul. On this, the chief admitted parties of
the enemy into the towers of his own Harem, which overlooked
the court-yard, in which the Sepoys were quartered.
Then the massacre commenced. Many of the
Sepoys were killed on the spot. Others threw themselves
over the walls, and were shot down outside the fort.
Woodburn himself, with a few of his men, took post in a
tower of their own court, and for some hours they gallantly
defended themselves. But they fell at last. The enemy
burnt them out; and massacred them almost to a man.</p>

<p>On receipt of this intelligence Rawlinson at once recommended
the General to halt Maclaren’s brigade. It
was accordingly brought back to Candahar. It was plain
that some mischief was brewing in the country to the
north. A week of doubt and anxiety passed; and then
letters came from Macnaghten and Elphinstone, announcing
that Caubul was in a state of insurrection,
and ordering Maclaren’s brigade to be despatched at
once to the capital. These letters came on with indorsements
from Colonel Palmer at Ghuznee, and Major
Leech at Khelat-i-Ghilzye, which showed that in the
intervening country there were signs of the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
storm.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On the 17th of November, accompanied by a
troop of horse artillery, the three regiments commenced
their march to the northward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Anticipating that some evil might arise from the presence
of the Prince, Sufder Jung, in the province, after
his supercession by his elder and better disposed brother,
Rawlinson had invited him to come in from Zemindawer,
and he now suggested the expediency of
his proceeding to Caubul, with Captain Hart’s Janbaz
regiment, which was to follow in the rear of Maclaren’s
brigade. The Prince yielded to the suggestion,
and went. The fidelity of the Afghan horse was doubtful,
and Rawlinson was glad to rid himself of the presence
both of a discontented Prince and a body of treacherous
Afghan horsemen&mdash;soldiers raised, mounted, armed,
equipped and disciplined by Shah Soojah and his British
supporters, seemingly for the one sole purpose of drawing
their swords against the very power to which they owed
their military existence.</p>

<p>All through the month of November Candahar remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
tranquil. But it was obvious that the course of
insurrection was setting towards the West. Tidings came
in from the country about Ghuznee, which showed that
the road to the capital was infested by the insurgents.
Lieutenant Crawford, who was escorting the Douranee
prisoners to Caubul had been attacked by overwhelming
numbers near Ghuznee; and had suffered his prisoners
to escape; or rather, had lost them, with all
his baggage, and a considerable number of his horses
and men.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Soon afterwards Guddoo Khan, an Afghan
officer in the service of the Shah and his British supporters,
who had accompanied Crawford’s detachment&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
man of unimpeachable integrity and unquestionable
gallantry and good conduct&mdash;was on his return from
Ghuznee to Candahar “overpowered by numbers and
slain, with seventeen of his best men, losing at the same
time forty-five horses, and all the arms and baggage of
the Ressaleh.” These incidents seemed to portend the
near approach of the thunder-clouds that were breaking
over Caubul. Candahar was as yet only beneath
the skirts of the storm.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December Maclaren’s brigade returned
to Candahar. How it happened that these regiments
had failed to make good their march to Caubul is not
to be satisfactorily explained. It is still stated by officers
who accompanied the detachment, that the difficulties of
the march have been greatly exaggerated; and that, at
all events, they might have been overcome. Nott sent
the brigade with a reluctance which he took no care
to conceal. It was his wish to retain the three regiments
at Candahar; and he was not a man to shrink
from the utterance of his feelings on such a subject as
this. “Remember,” he said to Maclaren and his staff,
when they presented themselves at the General’s quarters
to take leave of their old commandant, “the despatch
of this brigade to Caubul is not my doing. I am compelled
to defer to superior authority; but in my own
private opinion I am sending you all to destruction.”
The brigade marched; but, starting under such auspices,
there was little likelihood of its reaching its destination.
There were few officers in the force who did not know
that, on the first colourable pretext, it would be turned
back.</p>

<p>A pretext very soon presented itself. Two marches
beyond Khelat-i-Ghilyze there was a light fall of snow.
On the following day there was more snow, and some of
the commissariat donkeys died upon the road. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
next, Maclaren halted the brigade, and ordered a committee
to assemble and report upon the state of the commissariat
cattle, with reference to their fitness for the
continuance of their march to Caubul. The committee
assembled; registered the number of deaths among the
carriage-cattle during the two preceding days; and reported
that as winter had now set in, and as the loss of
cattle would increase every march that was made to the
northward, it would be impracticable for the force to
reach Caubul at all in an efficient state. On this, about
the end of November, Maclaren ordered the brigade to
retrace its steps.</p>

<p>But the snow had now ceased. The little that had
fallen soon melted away, and for weeks not another flake
fell throughout the entire country. The weather was remarkably
fine and open; and there is not a doubt that the
brigade might easily have made good its way to Caubul.
But it does not appear ever to have been seriously intended
that the force should reach its destination. Maclaren
and his officers knew well that the return of the
brigade to Candahar would be welcome to General Nott,
and that there was not likely to be a very close inquiry
into the circumstances attending the retrograde movement.
There was in reality little more than a show of
proceeding to the relief of Caubul. The regiments were
wanted at Candahar; and to Candahar they returned.
How far their arrival might have helped to save Elphinstone’s
force from destruction can only be conjectured.
But it is said that both the English and the Afghan
hosts looked with eager anxiety to the arrival or the
repulse of Maclaren, as the event which was to determine
the issue of the pending struggle. The relief of Ghuznee,
would in itself have been great gain to us, for it would
have opened the road between that place and Caubul,
and have sent many of the rebellious tribes to their home;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and that the appearance of reinforcements would have
determined many waverers, the venal and vacillating
Kuzzelbashes included, to side with the British, may be
recorded as a certainty. It is right, however, to admit
the belief, that if Nott had known to what straits the
Caubul army would soon be reduced, he would not have
uttered a word to encourage the return of the relieving
brigade to Candahar.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the causes of the failure,
soon after the retrograde movement of Maclaren’s brigade
became known, unmistakeable signs of inquietude were
discernible in the neighbourhood of Candahar. Mahomed
Atta Khan had been detached by the Caubul party to
raise an insurrection in Western Afghanistan. No sooner
had the chief reached the frontier than such unequivocal
symptoms of popular excitement began to manifest themselves,
that Major Rawlinson at once perceived the necessity
of adopting active measures for the suppression of disorder
and the maintenance of the tranquillity of the surrounding
country. His efforts in the first instance were directed to
the avoidance of any actual collision with the people, and
the preservation of outward smoothness and regularity in
the administration of affairs. With this primal object, he
withdrew from the outlying districts all the detached
troops, and concentrated them at Candahar. A single
party of Janbaz, protected by the Hazarehs from the
possibility of attack, were left in Tezeen, whilst all the
other troops, Hindostanee and Afghan, were posted in
and around the city of Candahar. But this was not
enough. The safety of our military position might be
provided for; but it was not sufficient to feel confident
of our ability to overcome any enemy that might venture
to attack us. It was obviously expedient to strike rather
at the root than at the branches; to prevent the growth
of rebellion rather than to beat it down full-grown. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
all events, it was politic to secure such a division of parties
as would annihilate even the possibility of a powerful
coalition against us. Relying upon the general unpopularity
of the Barukzyes with the Douranee tribes, whom
the Sirdars had so long and so severely oppressed, Major
Rawlinson exerted himself to get up a Douranee movement
in our favour. He bound the chiefs, by all the
most solemn oaths that Mahomedanism affords, to stand
firm in their allegiance to Shah Soojah and the Shah-zadah
Timour. The priesthood ratified the bond; and the
families of the Douranee chiefs were placed as hostages
for their fidelity in the hands of the British officers. The
chiefs themselves, with Prince Timour’s eldest son at their
head, and accompanied by Meerza Ahmed, the Revenue-manager
of Candahar, a man of considerable talents and
unsuspected fidelity, to whom Major Rawlinson had
entrusted a lakh of rupees for the management of the
movement, were despatched to the eastern frontier to
raise the tribes against the Barukzyes and their Ghilzye
allies. In the meanwhile the British at Candahar
remained apparently unconcerned spectators of the
contest, which, it was hoped, would resolve itself into
a question of Suddozye or Barukzye supremacy in the
Douranee Empire.</p>

<p>The objects contemplated by Major Rawlinson were,
however, only partially attained. He succeeded in gaining
time, and in removing the Douranee chiefs from the
neighbourhood of our camp. “The Douranees quitted
Candahar in the middle of December, delayed for a
considerable time the advance of Mahomed Atta Khan,
and prevented to the utmost of their power the spread
of religious fanaticism among their tribes.” But the
good faith so apparent at the outset was destined soon to
be overclouded. As long as the Douranees believed that
to carry out the wishes of the British was really to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the battle of the Suddozyes, they were true to our cause;
but they soon began to give credit to the report that
Shah Soojah himself was in the ranks of our enemies, and
then they fell away from us. Even Meerza Ahmed, in
whom so much confidence had been reposed, turned his
fine talents against us, and became the mainspring of a
hostile Douranee movement.</p>

<p>But they did not at once declare themselves. For
a while the Douranees quietly watched the progress of
affairs. Those events as they developed themselves
seemed more and more favourable to the spread of
insurrection in western Afghanistan. As the old year
wore to a close, it seemed that our difficulties were
thickening, and the new year came in with a crowd of
fresh embarrassments. Sufder Jung had returned to
Candahar. On the retrogression of Maclaren’s brigade
he had declared that he could not trust the Janbaz to
escort him to Caubul, and again set his face towards the
south. The presence of these traitorous horsemen at
Candahar had always been a source of considerable
anxiety to Major Rawlinson. The 1st Regiment of
Afghan horse had been in Zemindawer; and when the
political agent recalled the other troops from that part
of the country, it was his intention that the Janbaz
should remain at Ghirisk. Their enmity to the surrounding
tribes was so well known, that there was less
chance of their uniting with the rebels in that part of
the country than in any other. Owing, however, to
the miscarriage of a letter, Rawlinson’s intentions were
defeated. The Janbaz returned to Candahar with the
other details of the Zemindawer detachment, on the 9th
of December. But Rawlinson was determined to remove
them. He suspected their treachery; but sooner than
he anticipated, they threw off all disguise, and openly
arrayed themselves against us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Before daybreak on the 27th of December the men of
the Janbaz regiments were to have commenced their
march to Ghirisk. There were 250 men of the 1st
Regiment under Lieutenant Golding, and 150 of the 2nd
under Lieutenant Wilson. Lieutenant Pattinson was to
accompany them in political charge. The object of the
movement was two-fold&mdash;to escort treasure and ammunition
to Ghirisk, and to remove from Candahar a body
of men whose fidelity was more than suspected. Two
hours after midnight the party was to have moved and
made a double march, for the purpose of clearing the
villages on the Urghundab, which had been greatly
excited during the few preceding days. Golding was
ready at the appointed hour; but, through some misconception
of orders, Wilson’s men were not prepared to
march. So the movement was countermanded. Golding
and Pattinson, therefore, returned to the tent of the
former, and laid themselves down again to sleep. The
1st Janbaz regiment had been drawn up ready for the
march with their cattle loaded, and the postponement
of the movement now took them by surprise. They had
laid a plot to mutiny and desert upon the march, and
they believed that the conspiracy had been detected.
After waiting for half an hour, drawn up in the chill air
of early morning, they determined at once to throw off
the mask; so they streamed into Golding’s tent with
their drawn swords, and attacked the two officers in
their beds. When they thought that their bloody work
was complete, they rushed confusedly out of the tent,
mounted their horses, and fled. The treasure was
plundered, and some horses belonging to Golding and
Pattinson were carried off; but nothing else was touched
by the assassins. Pattinson was stunned by a blow on
the head, but recovering his senses, he made his way out
of the tent, wounded as he was in seven places, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a horse which his Meerza had saddled on the spot, and
effected his escape.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Golding was less fortunate. He
rushed out of his tent, and fled on foot towards the
cantonments; but the Janbaz followed and cut him
down when within a short distance of our camp.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>A party of the Shah’s horse under Captain Leeson,
and a detachment of Lieutenant Wilson’s Janbaz, who had
remained true to us in the face of strong temptation,
were sent out against the mutineers. The detachment
came up with the rebels about twelve miles from Candahar.
There was a brief but sturdy conflict. The
mutineers charged in a body, but were gallantly met by
Leeson’s men; and after a hand-to-hand struggle, were
broken and dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Thirty of their number were
killed by our cavalry, who followed up their advantage;
many more were wounded, and the remainder fled in
confusion to the camp of Atta Mahomed.</p>

<p>Two days after the defection of the Janbaz, Prince
Sufder Jung fled from Candahar, and joined the camp
of Atta Mahomed. The Sirdar had fixed his head-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
at Dehli, about forty miles from Candahar,
and there, early in January, Rawlinson was eager to
attack him. The political agent saw clearly the expediency
of crushing the insurrection in the bud. Every
day was adding to the importance of the movement, and
swelling the number of the insurgents. Some of the
tribes were standing aloof, unwilling to declare themselves
against us, yet in hourly expectation of being
compelled to secure their own safety by ranging themselves
under the banners of the Prince. But the General
was unwilling to divide his force; and refused to send a
brigade to Dehli. Whilst Rawlinson urged strong political
considerations in favour of promptitude of action, Nott,
with equal firmness, took his stand upon military grounds,
and argued that it would be inexpedient, at such a season
of the year, to send a portion of his force a distance of
forty miles from Candahar to beat up the quarters of a
fugitive Prince. “Sufder Jung,” wrote Rawlinson, “has
fixed his abode at Dehli, and has declared himself the
leader of an insurrection, aiming at our expulsion from
the country. Up to the present time no very considerable
number of men have joined his standard, and the
only chiefs in attendance of any note, are those who have
accompanied Mahomed Atta Khan from Caubul, together
with the Ghilzye leaders, Sumud Khan, Meer Alim Khan,
and the Gooroo. It would thus be an easy matter by the
detachment of a brigade to Dehli to break up the insurgent
force, and whether the rebels fought or fled, the
consequences would be almost of equal benefit with regard
to the restoration of tranquillity. But I anticipate a very
serious aggravation of affairs if we allow the Prince to
remain unmolested for any length of time at Dehli, or to
move from that place in the direction of Candahar with
the avowed purpose of attacking us. Our inactivity would
not fail to be ascribed by the great body of the Ooloos to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
an inability to act on the offensive, and an impression of
this sort having once gained ground, the natural consequences,
in the present highly excited state of religious
feeling, would be a general rise of the population against
us.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Reason and experience were both on the side of this
argument, and Rawlinson stated the case clearly and
well. But Nott took a soldier’s view of the question.
He argued, that to send out a brigade at such a season
of the year, so far from its supports, would be to destroy
his men in the field, and to expose the city to the attacks
of the enemy. “I conceive,” he wrote in reply to Rawlinson’s
letter, “that the whole country is in a state of
rebellion, and that nothing but the speedy concentration
of the troops at this place has saved the different detachments
from being destroyed in detail, and the city of
Candahar from being besieged.... Because this
young Prince is said to have assembled 1000 or 1500
followers at a distance of forty miles from Candahar, it
would, indeed, be truly absurd were I, in the very depth
of winter, to send a detachment wandering about the
country in search of the rebel fugitive, destroying my
men amidst frost and snow, killing the few carriage-cattle
we have left, and thus be totally disabled at the proper
season from moving ten miles in any direction from the
city, or even have the means of falling back, should that
unfortunately ever become necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The movements of the rebel army soon settled the
question between them. No attempt having been made
to dislodge the insurgent chiefs, they quietly moved down
the valley of the Urghundab, and on the 12th of January
took post on the river, about five miles to the west of the
city of Candahar.</p>

<p>General Nott lost no time in moving out to attack
them. Taking with him five and a half regiments of
infantry, the Shah’s 1st Cavalry, a party of Skinner’s
Horse, and sixteen guns,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> a formidable body of troops,
weak only in the mounted branch&mdash;he made a four
hours’ march over a few miles of country, and came
upon the enemy,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> posted near the fortified village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Killa-chuk, on the right bank of the Urghundab. The
British troops crossed the river, and at once advanced in
column of battalions, flanked by the artillery and cavalry,
to the attack. The action was of brief duration. At
the end of twenty minutes, during which our guns and
musketry, telling with deadly effect upon the heavy
masses of the enemy, were answered by a wild and
ineffective fire from their ranks, the rebel army was in
confusion and flight. The Ghilzyes fled in one direction;
the Janbaz in another; the people from the villages<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
hastened to their own homes. Atta Mahomed attempted
to make a stand; but our troops moved forward&mdash;carried
the village by storm&mdash;and slaughtered every man, woman,
and child, within its walls. The British line was then reformed,
and Atta Mahomed prepared to meet a second
attack. But the cavalry, with two horse-artillery guns,
were now slipped upon the enemy, who broke and fled
in dismay; and the humiliation of Atta Mahomed and
his princely ally was complete.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Douranee chiefs now began to throw off the mask.
They moved down to the assistance of the rebel army,
but the battle had been fought before they could arrive
upon the field, and they only came up in time to see
their countrymen in panic flight.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Sufder Jung, Atta
Mahomed, and the other rebel chiefs found an honourable
refuge in the Douranee camp; and from that time,
they who had left Candahar as our friends, presented a
front of open hostility to our authority.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Meerza Ahmed was the head-piece of the Douranee
party. Nott had pronounced him a traitor.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Rawlinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had now ceased to believe in his fidelity; but he had
never ceased to respect his talents. He knew him to be
an Afghan of rare ability, and he believed that the
sagacity of the Meerza would not suffer him to doubt
the difference between the power of his countrymen and
that of the British Government. But the Meerza had
sounded the depth of the difficulties which surrounded us
with no little accuracy, and had estimated aright the
nature of the crisis. He saw in the distance our compulsory
abandonment of Afghanistan, and doubted the
wisdom of leaguing himself with a declining cause.</p>

<p>From the 20th of January to the last day of February
the Douranees remained encamped in the neighbourhood
of Candahar. Nothing but the genius of Meerza Ahmed
could have kept together, throughout so long a season of
comparative inactivity, all the discordant elements of that
Douranee force. The winter had set in with its snowy
accessories. Nott was unwilling to expose his troops to
the severities of the winter season; and the enemy seemed
equally disinclined for war whilst the snow was on the
ground. But during this period of suspended hostilities
very different were the occupations of the two contending
forces&mdash;very different the feelings with which they contemplated
the renewal of the struggle. The attitude of
the British at this time denoted a consciousness of
strength. There was no despondency&mdash;there was no
excitement. Our officers and men, having nothing to
do in the field, fell back again into the ordinary routine
of cantonment life, as though the country had never
been convulsed or disturbed. They rode steeple-chases;
they played at rackets; they pelted one another with
snow-balls. The dreadful snow which had destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Caubul army was only a plaything in the hands of their
brethren at Candahar.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The enemy, on the other hand, were kept continually
in a state of restless and absorbing activity. Meerza
Ahmed saw the danger of suffering the Douranee chiefs,
disunited and jealous of each other as they were, to
dwell too intently upon the embarrassments of their
own position. He gave their thoughts an outward
direction; and, by skilful management, kept them both
from risking prematurely a general engagement with
the British, and from breaking out into internal dissensions.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
“Meerza Ahmed alone,” says Major Rawlinson,
in the masterly despatch I have already quoted,
“could have so long preserved union among the discordant
elements of which this camp was composed; he
alone could have managed, by the most careful revenue
arrangements, to have supported the concourse which was
assembled round the standard of Sufder Jung; he alone,
perhaps, could have prevented the Douranees from risking
an action in which they were sure to be defeated; his
measures throughout have been most skilful and well
sustained. The chiefs were, in the first place, sent to
recruit in the different districts where their influence
chiefly prevailed; revenue was raised in the usual form
for the support of the troops in anticipation of the coming
harvest, the ryots receiving an acquittance from Meerza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Ahmed in case the management should continue in his
hands, and being assured that if our power prevailed we
were too just to subject the cultivators to a double
exaction; statements of the Shah’s connivance in the
Caubul revolution were industriously circulated; incessant
attempts were made to tamper with our
Hindostanee troops (not altogether without success),
and letters were designedly thrown into our hands to
render us suspicious of such chiefs as adhered to us,
whilst the most stringent measures were adopted to deter
the villagers around the city from bringing supplies into
Candahar. Such was the line of policy pursued by
Meerza Ahmed from the 20th of January to the 20th
of February. In this interim General Nott had laid in
five months’ supplies for the troops; he had repaired the
fortifications to a certain extent; and, intending on the
12th of February to march out and attack the enemy,
he had concurred in the advisability of disarming the
population preparatory to the movement of our troops.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Severe weather, however, rendered a march impracticable
at the time he meditated; and before it became
sufficiently mild to enable him to take the field, the
tactics of the enemy had undergone a total alteration
in consequence of advices from Caubul.”</p>

<p>But there were many circumstances at this time to
create uneasiness in the minds of those to whom was
entrusted the direction of affairs at Candahar. The
garrison was not threatened with a scarcity of provisions;
but fodder for the cattle was very scarce. The horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
were becoming unserviceable from lack of nourishment;
the sheep were so miserably lean as to be scarcely worth
killing for food. It was intensely cold; and fuel was so
scarce, that the luxury of a winter fire was denied even
to the sick. The hospitals had their inmates; but there
were no medicines. And above all, money was becoming
so scarce, that the most serious apprehensions were
entertained by Major Rawlinson, who knew that there
was no weapon of war so serviceable as the money-bag
in such a country as Afghanistan.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Under such circumstances
it may readily be supposed how anxiously the
arrival of a convoy from the southward was looked for,
and how necessary it seemed that the communications
with Sindh should be opened in such a manner as to
secure the arrival of treasure and supplies.</p>

<p>But whilst the hopes of the garrison were directed
towards the country to the southward, their thoughts,
with fear and trembling, turned themselves towards the
North. On the 21st of February a messenger arrived at
Candahar, bringing a letter from General Elphinstone
and Major Pottinger, ordering the evacuation of Candahar
and Khelat-i-Ghilzye.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The original had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
written nearly two months before; and that which now
reached Major Rawlinson was a copy forwarded by Leech
from Khelat-i-Ghilzye.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> There was no doubt in Rawlinson’s
mind about the genuine character of the document;
but he could not bring himself to recognise for a
moment the obligations which it was intended to impose
upon him. He could not, however, help perceiving
that the turn which political affairs had taken in Caubul
placed him in a strange and anomalous position. Shah
Soojah was now the recognised sovereign of Afghanistan,
ruling by the consent and with the aid of the Barukzye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
chiefs; and it could no longer be said that the presence
of the British troops was necessary to the support
of the Suddozye Kings. The Douranee chiefs saw this
as plainly as Rawlinson; and they did not fail to take
advantage of the circumstance. They now endeavoured
to reason the British out of Candahar when they found
it difficult to expel them; and Rawlinson and Nott
found it less easy to rebut their arguments than to repel
their assaults.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of February, Rawlinson received a packet
of letters from the Douranee camp, the contents of which
supplied much food for earnest reflection. Sufder Jung
and the Douranee chiefs wrote to the British agent, setting
forth that, as it had always been declared that the
British merely occupied the country in support of Shah
Soojah, and as the Shah was now recognised by the
chiefs and the people, and had no longer any need of
our support, it was incumbent upon us to withdraw from
the country. If, it was added, the British would now
consent to retire from Candahar, an unmolested passage
to Quettah would be guaranteed to them; but that, if
they insisted on maintaining their position, they must
expect that the fate of the Caubul army would be theirs.
Meerza Ahmed, in a private letter to Rawlinson, besought
him to retire before the whole Douranee nation
rose against the British. But perhaps the most important
of the letters brought in that morning, was one from
Shah Soojah to Prince Timour, to the following effect:
“You must understand that the disturbances which you
have, no doubt, heard of at Caubul, have been a contest
between the followers of Islam and the unbelievers.
Now that the affair is decided, all the Afghans have
tendered their allegiance to me, and recognised me as
King. It is necessary that you should keep me duly informed
of all proceedings in your government; and rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
assured of my favour and affection.” When Rawlinson
took this letter to the Shaz-zadah Timour, the Prince at
once declared it to be a forgery; but the British officer
knew how to decypher stranger characters than those
of a Persian <i>Dust-Khut</i>, and to decide upon the authenticity
of far more perplexing scriptures. Rawlinson’s
practised eye saw at once that the document was a
genuine one.</p>

<p>The letter from the chiefs demanded an answer; and
Rawlinson now took counsel with the General. The
hour for decision had arrived. It became them to look
their position boldly in the face, and to shape their
course for the future. Nott was not a man to listen
patiently to the language of insolent dictation from the
Afghan chiefs. He had already made up his mind to
maintain his position at all risks, pending the receipt
of instructions from India issued subsequently to the
receipt by government of intelligence of the Envoy’s
murder.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Rawlinson was of the same opinion. So he
drew up a letter to the Douranee chiefs, setting forth
that, as there was every reason to believe that Shah
Soojah was acting under compulsion, and that he in
reality, in spite of existing appearances, desired the support
of the British, it would not become the latter to
withdraw from Afghanistan before entering into a final
explanation with the King. He drew the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the chiefs to the difference of our positions at Caubul
and Candahar&mdash;said that any attempt to expel us by
force must inevitably fail&mdash;and recommended the Douranees
to refrain from engaging in unprofitable hostility.
But he added, that the British had no desire to
conquer the country for themselves&mdash;that the Candahar
army was only waiting for instructions from government&mdash;and
he believed it was the desire of that government
to restore to Shah Soojah the uncontrolled exercise
of his authority, and to be guided by the provisions of
a new treaty which would probably be negotiated between
the two states.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> On the following day,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> the
despatch of the letter having been delayed by the
difficulty of finding a trustworthy messenger, Rawlinson
added a postscript, setting forth that intelligence had
since been received, which clearly demonstrated that
the Shah was little more than a prisoner in the hands
of the Barukzyes; and he added, that forces were on
their way from India to avenge the murder of the
Envoy.</p>

<p>The activity of Rawlinson, at this time, was unceasing.
He exerted himself, and often with good success, to detach
different tribes from the rebel cause; and was continually
corresponding both with the chiefs in the Douranee
camp and in the neighbouring villages. It was
his policy to draw off the Barukzyes from the Douranee
confederacy, and to stimulate the Douranees against the
Barukzyes, by declaring that the Shah was a mere instrument
in the hands of the latter. It was debated, indeed,
whether the Douranees could not be induced to move off
to Caubul for the rescue of the King.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in spite of these and other favourable indications,
it appeared, both to the military and political chief at
Candahar, that it was necessary now to strike some
vigorous blow for the suppression of the insurrection and
the maintenance of our own security. So Nott determined
to attack the enemy; and Rawlinson, after many
misgivings, to expel the Afghans from the city. This
movement he had been painfully contemplating all
through the month of February; and now, at the beginning
of March, he believed that he could no longer
postpone, with safety, the accomplishment of this harsh,
but necessary, measure of defence.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> All doubts regarding
the wishes of the Indian Government had been, by this
time, set at rest by the receipt of a copy of a letter,
addressed by the Supreme Government to the Commander-in-Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
on the 28th of January, in which letter
the continued occupation of Candahar was spoken of as
an event which the British-Indian Government believed
would be conducive to the interests of the state; and it
afforded no small pleasure to Nott and Rawlinson to find
how completely they had anticipated the wishes of the
Governor-General and his Council.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of March, Rawlinson began to clear the city
of its Afghan inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Inspecting the census he had
made, and selecting a few who were to be permitted to
remain&mdash;peaceful citizens, as merchants, followers of
useful trades, and a few members of the priesthood, he
expelled the remainder of the Afghan inhabitants&mdash;in all,
about 1000 families. No resistance was offered. The
work was not completed before the close of the 6th. The
municipal authorities performed their duties so remissly,
that it was necessary to tell off an officer and a party of
Sepoys to each district, to see that the clearance was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
effectually performed. Some 5000 or 6000 people were
driven out of the city. Every exertion was made to
render the measure as little oppressive as possible; but
the expulsion of so many citizens from their homes could
not be altogether free from cruelty and injustice.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The city having thus been cleared of all its suspected
inhabitants, Nott, on the 7th of March, took the field,
with the main body of his troops. The 40th Queen’s&mdash;the
16th, 38th, 42nd, and 43rd regiments of Native
Infantry&mdash;a wing of one of the Shah’s regiments&mdash;all the
cavalry in the force, and sixteen guns, went out against
the enemy. The 2nd regiment of Native Infantry, with
two regiments and a wing of the Shah’s foot, remained
behind for the protection of the city. All the gates of
the city, but the Herat and a part of the Shikarpoor
gate, were blocked up, and Candahar was believed to be
secure against the assaults of the whole Douranee force.</p>

<p>As Nott advanced, the enemy, who had been hovering
about the neighbourhood of Candahar, retired before him.
He crossed the Turnuk and advanced upon the Urghundab
in pursuit of them; but they shrank from meeting our
bayonets, and it was long before they even ventured to
come within reach of our guns. The artillery then told
with such good effect on the dense masses of the enemy,
that they were more than ever disinclined to approach us.
On the 9th, however, there seemed some prospect of a
general action. The enemy’s footmen were posted on a
range of hills, and, as our column advanced, they saluted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
us with a volley from their matchlocks. The light companies
of the 40th Queen’s and 16th Native Infantry,
under Captain F. White, of the former regiment, were
sent forward to storm the hills on the right; and the
Grenadiers of the 40th, under Lieutenant Wakefield, performed
the same good service on the ascents to the left.
The hills were soon cleared; and the enemy’s cavalry
were then seen drawn up in front of our columns. Their
line extended across the plain; their right resting upon a
range of high ground, and their left on a ruined fort, built
on a high scarped mound.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Hoping to draw them within
his reach, the General now kept his guns quiet. But they
were not inclined to meet us in the field. They were
planning another game.</p>

<p>Whether it had been the original design of the Douranee
chiefs to draw Nott’s army out of Candahar, and to
strip the city of its defences; or whether, awed by the
magnitude of the force which the General had taken
out with him, they shrunk from the conflict, was not
at first very apparent.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But it subsequently became
known to the British authorities that the stratagem
was planned by the subtle understanding of Meerza
Ahmed. The enemy, after the skirmish of the 9th
instant, retired before our advancing battalions, and,
industriously spreading a report that they purposed to
attack Nott’s camp during the night, recrossed the
river and doubled back upon Candahar. Up to this
time the city had remained perfectly quiet; and the
minds of the British authorities had not been disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by any thoughts of coming danger. But on the morning
of the 10th it was seen that a number of Afghan footmen
had come down during the preceding night and taken
possession of old Candahar. Rawlinson at once despatched
three messengers to Nott’s camp, to inform him
that the enemy had doubled back in his rear, and that
it was apparently their intention to attack the city.
His suspicions were soon confirmed. His scouts brought
him intelligence to the effect that the Douranee army
was to concentrate during the day, before Candahar, and to
attack it in the course of the night. All day long the
numbers of the enemy continued to increase, and at sunset
Sufder Jung and Meerza Ahmed arrived and posted
themselves in the cantonments. Night came on with
pitchy darkness; and the garrison could not trace the
movements of the enemy. They had no blue lights&mdash;no
fire-balls&mdash;no means of casting a light beyond the defences
of the city. The Ghazees were swarming close to the
walls; and at eight o’clock they commenced the attack.
They had heaped up some faggots at the Herat gate; and
now they fired the pile. They had poured oil on the
brushwood, and now it blazed up with sudden fury.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
gate itself ignited as readily as tinder, and the flames now
lit up the mass of white turbans, the gleaming arms, and
the coloured standards, which had before been only seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in scattered glimpses, by the momentary light of the
kindled match of the Afghan jezails.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Desperate was the attack of the Ghazees, and steady
the resistance of the garrison. A gun upon the bastion
poured in its deadly shower of grape among the besiegers;
and the guard kept up a heavy fire from the ramparts.
But the Ghazees pressed on with desperate resolution.
The success of their first movement had given them confidence
and courage; and now they were tearing down
the blazing planks with intrepid hands, fearless of the
red-hot bars and hinges of the falling gate. Many of
them, intoxicated with bang, were sending up the fearful
yell of the Afghan fanatic, and rushing upon death with
the eagerness of the martyr. Others were calling upon
Prince Timour to come out and win Paradise by aiding
the cause of the true believers. At one time it seemed
that victory would declare itself on the side of the infuriated
multitude that was surging round the city walls.
But there were men within the city as resolute, and far
more steady and collected in their resolution, than the
excited crowds beyond it, who were hungering after our
destruction. Major Lane commanded the garrison. Rawlinson
was there to counsel and to aid him. They brought
down the gun from the bastion, and planted it in the
gateway. They brought another from the citadel to its
support. They strengthened the point of attack with
fresh bodies of infantry, and called out all the water-carriers
to endeavour to extinguish the flames. But
more serviceable even than these movements was one
which opposed a solid obstacle to the entrance of the
besieging multitude. They brought down from the Commissariat
godowns a number of grain-bags, and piled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
up at the burning gate. About nine o’clock the gate fell
outwards, and then a party of Ghazees climbed the lofty
barricade of grain-bags, as men weary of their lives.
Many fell dead or desperately wounded beneath the
heavy fire of our musketry. Spirited was the attack&mdash;spirited
the defence. The fate of Candahar seemed to
tremble in the balance. For three more hours the
Ghazees renewed, at intervals, the assault upon the gateway;
but they could not make good their entrance to the
city; and at midnight they drew off in despair.</p>

<p>Whilst this desperate struggle was going on at the
Herat gate of the city, attempts had been made upon
the Shikarpoor and Caubul gates. But the enemy could
not fire the brushwood they had collected. The garrison
were too prompt and alert. It appears that Meerza
Ahmed, confident of the success of the attack upon the
Herat gate, had arranged that a given signal should
announce this success, and that then he should proceed
to the assault of the Eedgah gate leading to the citadel.
But when at midnight the attack was finally repulsed, a
council of war was held. Baffled in their attempts on
the city, the angry fanatics levelled the most violent
reproaches against Meerza Ahmed, and were with difficulty
restrained from laying violent hands on the man,
who, they declared, had betrayed them into an attempt
which had sacrificed the lives of hundreds of true believers,
and ended only in failure and disgrace. It is
said that the Ghazees lost six hundred men in the
attempt. They were busy until daybreak in carrying
off the dead.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted that, during that night of
the 10th of March, Candahar was in imminent danger.
Had the city fallen into the hands of the enemy at this
time, it is doubtful whether Nott’s force, on its return,
would have succeeded in recapturing it. The troops had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
gone out without tents, and were insufficiently supplied
with ammunition. Everything, indeed, was against them;
and even if the courage and constancy of the force had
prevailed at last, success could have been achieved only
after an immense sacrifice of life. That the General was
out-manœuvred, is plain. But it may be doubted whether
he is fairly chargeable with the amount of indiscretion
which has been imputed to him. It has been said that
he left the city unprotected. But as he was to have
engaged the enemy himself in the open country, and all
sources of internal danger had been removed by the
expulsion of the Afghans and the disarming of the other
inhabitants, it was confidently believed that the troops
left in the city were more than sufficient for its defence.
It must, however, be acknowledged that Nott was lamentably
ignorant of the movements of the enemy, who doubled
back in his rear without raising a suspicion of their designs
in the British camp. But this is no new thing in Indian
warfare. To be ignorant of the intentions of the
enemy is the rule, not the exception, of Indian generalship.
Our intelligence-department is always so miserably
defective, that we lose the enemy often as suddenly
as we find him, and are either running ourselves unexpectedly
upon him, or suffering him to slip out of our
hands.</p>

<p>General Nott re-entered Candahar on the 12th of
March. The repulse which the insurgents had received
at the city gate gave a heavy blow to their cause. It
brought disunion into the Douranee camp, and made
the Ghazees denounce the chiefs who had plunged them
into disaster, and resolve to forswear the perilous trade of
fanaticism which brought so much suffering upon them.
The ryots, who had joined the standard of the true
believers, now returned in numbers to their peaceful
avocations; and Major Rawlinson exerted himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
utmost to re-assure the public mind, and restore peace
and prosperity to the surrounding villages.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> As the
month advanced there were many encouraging signs of
the approaching dissolution of the Douranee camp. Some
of its components were already talking of moving off to
Caubul; and it was said that Meerza Ahmed had sent his
family to the capital preparatory to retreating in that
direction himself.</p>

<p>But there is never anything sustained and consistent
in Afghan politics. The appearances of to-day belie the
appearances of yesterday, and are again succeeded by
varied symptoms to-morrow. The Douranee chiefs at one
time seemed to be on the point of a general disruption;
and then, after the lapse of a few days, they met in
council, and cooling down under a shower of mutual
reproaches, swore solemn oaths to be true to each other,
and to league themselves together for another attack
upon the Feringhees. At the end of the third week of
March they were again upon the move. Upon the 24th,
they were within a short distance of Killa-chuk, where
Nott had before attacked them. On this day the Parsewan
Janbaz attempted to renew certain negotiations,
which they had initiated a few days before, but which had
been coldly received. They offered to quit the Douranee
camp and to move off to Caubul, if a month’s pay were
given them to defray their expenses on the march. But
Nott indignantly rejected the proposal. “I will never
give them,” he wrote to Rawlinson, “one rupee; and if I
can ever get near them I will destroy them to a man. It
is my wish that no communications shall be held with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
them. They have murdered our people, and plundered
the country.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>On the following day, our troops again encountered the
enemy in the field. A brigade under Colonel Wymer had
been sent out, partly to clear the country on the Candahar
side of the Urghundab from the Douranee horse, who
were threatening our position, and partly to relieve the
garrison, which was straitened for forage, by sending out
the camels to graze in the open country. Wymer took
with him three regiments of infantry, a troop of horse
artillery, and a party of some four hundred mounted men.
In the neighbourhood of Baba-Wallee the Douranee horse
crossed the river&mdash;3000 strong&mdash;to attack him. Having
sent a messenger to Candahar to inform the General of
his position, Wymer prepared to defend himself. He had
to guard his cattle as well as to fight the enemy; and the
former necessity greatly crippled his movements. Weak,
as the Candahar detachments always were, in the mounted
branch, he found himself at a disadvantage opposed to
the large bodies of the enemy’s horse, who now appeared in
his front. Our Hindostanee cavalry were driven in by the
Douranees under Saloo Khan, who gallantly charged
our squares.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But the fire of our guns and the volleys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
our musketry soon checked the audacity of the Afghan
horsemen; and the affair became one of distant skirmishes.
But, in the mean while, the roar of our artillery had been
distinctly heard at Candahar, and Nott had moved out to
the support of Wymer’s brigade. The Douranees were
still surrounding our camp, when the General, with the
reinforcing brigade, entered the valley. What the men
who followed Nott then saw, is described as “a beautiful
spectacle,” which will not readily be forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The
bright afternoon sun shed its slant rays upon the sabres
of the enemy, and lit them up like a burning forest. Our
infantry were drawn up in a hollow square covering a
crowd of camels; the horse artillery guns, which had
done such good service before, were playing gloriously,
under Turner’s direction, upon the dense bodies of the
enemy’s horse, whom their heavy fire kept at a cautious
distance. “And just as General Nott,” adds an eye-witness,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
“with the reinforcements came in sight, Lieutenant
Chamberlaine, of the Bengal service, an officer in
the Shah’s cavalry, who at the head of a small party had
charged the enemy, was driven back, and, emerging from
a cloud of dust, formed in rear of the infantry, with the
loss of a few men killed, himself and many of his party
wounded&mdash;but not without having given very satisfactory
proofs of his power as a swordsman, albeit his treacherous
weapon had broken in his hand.” As our reinforcing
regiments approached, the enemy retired; and our cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
were quite useless.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The Douranee camp had been left
standing, and Nott, though the day was far advanced, was
eager to cross the river and attack it; but the guns could
not be brought down to the bank without great labour,
and the fords were well-nigh impracticable. So Nott
determined to withdraw the brigade to Candahar for the
night, leaving Wymer in position, and to return on the
following morning to disperse the Douranee horse.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, Nott went out again, with
the brigade that had accompanied him on the preceding
day, to the banks of the Urghundab; but the enemy had
struck their camp during the night; and as soon as day
broke, the Douranee horse had moved off and dispersed
themselves in different bodies. So the General returned
to Candahar; whilst Colonel Wymer re-halted in the
valley to graze his cattle, unmolested and secure. Rawlinson
remained in the valley throughout the day, “visiting
the different villages, conversing with the Moollahs
and head-men, and endeavouring to restore confidence.
Imprecations against the Ghazees were general in every
village, and the damage which had been caused by their
depredations was evidently very great.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The result of this affair was a growth of fresh disunion
in the Douranee camp. The chiefs accused each other of
cowardice, and all assailed Meerza Ahmed with measureless
abuse. But tidings were now coming in, both from
the north and the south, which went some way to comfort
and re-assure them. It was currently reported in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
camp that Ghuznee had capitulated. This intelligence
had been received some days before by the British officers
at Candahar, and had not been disbelieved. On the 31st
of March, a letter from Major Leech, at Khelat-i-Ghilzye,
was received by Nott at Candahar, and though it announced
the fall of Ghuznee only on native authority, it
seemed to divest the fact entirely of all atmosphere of
doubt. It appeared, from the statements that reached
Candahar, that Ghuznee had been invested by an overwhelming
force, and that, after holding out for some
weeks, the garrison had been reduced more by a want of
water than by the attacks of the enemy. It was reported,
that before the arrival of orders from Caubul for the
evacuation of the place, the town of Ghuznee had been
taken by the surrounding tribes&mdash;“that the Hindoos of
the Bazaar were all killed, fighting on our side&mdash;that
Palmer, during the two months he was in the Balla
Hissar, paid a daily sum for his provisions, water, and
wood&mdash;that Shumshoodeen was the bearer of orders from
the British at Caubul to give up the fortress&mdash;that the
failure of water was the reason that made him agree to
vacate the upper citadel on the 8th instant&mdash;that the
mass of Ghazees did not respect the treaty formed, with a
guarantee given to Palmer by Shumshoodeen, but attacked
our garrison, and they only 400 strong, on their leaving
the citadel, killing 100 and losing many themselves&mdash;that
Palmer now wanted a guarantee for the safety of the
officers, and that this being given, they surrendered themselves
with two or three European females.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> At the
same time, Leech reported that he was in possession of a
letter, bearing the seal of Shumshoodeen Khan, and
addressed to the Shamalzye chiefs, exhorting them to
assemble and march on Khelat-i-Ghilzye, and holding out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to them hopes of honour and wealth to be conferred
upon them by the King and Ameen-oollah Khan, if they
succeeded in capturing the place; and promising himself,
upon the breaking up of the snow, to march down upon
it “with fort-destroying guns and an army crowned with
victory.”</p>

<p>The tidings of the fall of Ghuznee were most calamitously
true. The fortress, which the English had taken
with so much difficulty, and the capture of which had
been proclaimed with so much pomp, was now in the
hands of the enemy. The slight outline of the melancholy
events which had ended in the destruction of the garrison
and the captivity of the surviving officers, which Leech
had sent from Khelat-i-Ghilzye, was substantially correct.
The enemy appeared before Ghuznee on the 20th
of November. On the same day snow began to fall.
Maclaren’s brigade was then advancing from Candahar,
and the enemy, expecting its appearance in their neighbourhood,
drew off their investing force; but they soon
reappeared again. Maclaren’s retirement gave them new
heart; and on the 7th of December they collected again,
in increased numbers, around the walls. The garrison
were now completely enlaced. The city was in their
possession, but they could not stir beyond it. Soon,
however, they lost even that. The inhabitants undermined
the walls, and admitted the enemy from without.
On the 16th of December, through the subterranean
aperture which the townspeople had made, the enemy
streamed in by thousands. The city was now no longer
tenable. The garrison shut themselves up in the citadel.</p>

<p>The winter now set in with appalling severity. The
Sepoys, kept constantly on the alert, sunk beneath the
paralysing cold. Bravely as they tried to bear up against
it, the trial was beyond their physical capacity to endure.
The deep snow was lying on the ground; it was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
falling heavily when the Sepoys were on their cold night-watch.
The mercury in the thermometer had fallen
many degrees below zero. Men who had spent all their
lives on the burning plains of Hindostan, and drunk their
tepid water out of vessels scorched by the fierce rays of
the Indian sun, were now compelled to break the ice in
the wells before they could allay their thirst. Fuel was
so scarce, that a single seer<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of wood was all that each
man received in the day to cook his dinner and keep off
the assaults of the mysterious enemy that was destroying
them. They were on half-rations; and the scanty provisions
that were served out to them were of such a
quality that only severe hunger could reconcile them
to it. Numbers of them were carried into hospital
miserably frost-bitten. The northern climate was doing
its work.</p>

<p>The Afghans, in the mean while, in possession of the
city, continued to harass the garrison in the citadel, by
firing upon them whenever they showed their heads above
the walls. This continued till the middle of the month
of January, when, it appears, that some suspension of
hostilities supervened. It was believed that the English
at Caubul had entered into a treaty with the Afghan
Sirdars; and that Shumshoodeen Khan would shortly
arrive with orders from the existing government to assume
possession of the place. Weeks, however, passed away,
and the new governor did not make his appearance.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
About the middle of February he arrived, and summoned
Palmer to surrender. Unwilling to submit to the humiliating
demand, and yet hopeless of the efficacy of resistance,
the English officer contrived to amuse the Sirdar
until the beginning of March. Then the patience of
Shumshoodeen Khan and the other chiefs was exhausted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and they swore that they would recommence hostilities
with unsparing ferocity if the citadel were not instantly
surrendered. So, on the 6th of March, Palmer and
his men marched out of the citadel. The enemy had
solemnly sworn to conduct them in safety to Peshawur,
with their colours, arms, and baggage, and fifty rounds
of ammunition in the pouches of each of our fighting
men.</p>

<p>But it soon became only too miserably apparent that
the enemy had sworn falsely to protect Palmer and his
men. The British troops had scarcely taken up their
abode in the quarter of the town which had been assigned
to them, when the Afghan chiefs threw off the mask. On
the day after their departure from the citadel, when the
Sepoys were cooking their dinner, the Ghazees rushed
with sudden fury on their lines. Three days of terror
followed. House after house, in which the English officers
and their suffering Hindostanee followers endeavoured
manfully to defend themselves, was attacked by the
infuriated enemy. Fire, famine, and slaughter were all
working together to destroy our unhappy men. At last,
on the morning of the 20th, the survivors were huddled
together in two houses which had been assigned to the
head-quarters of the force&mdash;soldiers and camp-followers,
men, women, and children, crammed to suffocation in
every room, all hourly expecting death. The enemy were
swarming around. The citadel guns, which had been
useless in our hands, but were now most effective in those
of the enemy, were sending their round-shot “crashing
through and through the walls.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Hour after hour, and
still the enemy seemed to pause, as though unwilling to
shorten, by a last annihilating attack, the sufferings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
their victims.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> But Shumshoodeen Khan had begun to
relent. He was in council with the other Sirdars; and it
was determined that the wretched men, who were now
so wholly at their mercy, should be admitted to terms.
The Ghazees were still crying aloud for their blood. But
the chiefs assured the officers of their safety, if they
would lay down their arms and place themselves in their
hands. The Sepoys had by this time thrown off all
authority, and determined to make their own way to
Peshawur.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> So the British officers, under a solemn oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
from the chiefs that they should be honourably treated
and conducted in safety to Caubul, laid down their arms,
and trusted to the good faith of the Afghan Sirdars.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
The Sepoys, in the mean while, were endeavouring to
prosecute their insane scheme of escaping across the
open country to Peshawur. Snow began to fall heavily.
They wandered about the fields helpless and bewildered.
Many of them were cut down or made prisoners by the
enemy; and to all who survived, officers and men alike,
a time of suffering now commenced, all the circumstances
of which are burnt into their memories as with a brand
of iron.</p>

<p>The fall of Ghuznee was a great disaster and a great
discredit. Among the officers of Nott’s division it was
regarded as more disgraceful than the loss of Caubul.
Want of water was said to be the cause of Palmer’s surrender;
but it was believed that he might have retained
possession of the great well by running a covered way
down the mound; and it is still asserted that if he had
taken the more decided step of expelling the treacherous
inhabitants from the town, he might have held out until
he was relieved from Candahar. This at least would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
have given him both firewood and water. And it is not
improbable that Afghan cupidity would have prevailed
over Afghan resentment, and that grain and other provisions
would have been brought in to him in return for
bills on the British Government. But Palmer wanted
decision; and Ghuznee was lost.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Khelat-i-Ghilzye was gallantly
holding out against the enemy. Situated between
Ghuznee and Candahar, about eighty miles from the
latter city, this isolated fortress stands upon a barren
eminence, exposed to the wintry winds and driving dust-storms&mdash;one
of the dreariest and bleakest spots in all the
country of Afghanistan. It had been originally garrisoned
by the Shah’s 3rd infantry regiment, a party of forty
European artillerymen, and some sappers and miners;
but Maclaren’s brigade, on its return towards Candahar,
had dropped some 250 Sepoys of the 43rd Regiment at
Khelat-i-Ghilzye to strengthen the garrison; and now,
commanded by Captain John Halkett Craigie, of the
Shah’s service, this little party prepared to resist the
assaults of the investing enemy and the cruel cold. For
months the cold was far more irresistible than the enemy.
In that bleak, exposed situation, the icy winds were continually
blowing from the north. “The lower the temperature
sunk, the higher blew the north wind.” The
barracks were unfinished; there were neither doors nor
windows to keep out the chilling blasts; and there was
a scanty supply of firewood in store. How the Hindostanee
soldiers bore up against it, it is difficult to say,
for the European officers declare that they “never
experienced a winter so continuously cold.” There was
an abundance of grain in store; but all the surrounding
country was against them, and the wheat could not be
ground. After more than two months of ineffectual
labour they at last constructed serviceable hand-mills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
The Europeans often lived for days together upon bread
and water; but not a murmur arose. The winter passed
wearily away. The enemy were inactive. But with spring
came a renewal of active work on either side. The garrison
were labouring to strengthen their defences, and
the enemy, as the year advanced, began to draw more
closely round the fortress, their numbers and their boldness
increasing together. After a time, they began to
dig trenches round the place, and, covered by the loopholed
parapets, to keep up a hot fire upon the garrison,
which it was impossible to return with good effect. But
Craigie and his men had no thought of surrender. They
held out, cheerfully and uncomplainingly, thankful if they
could get a shot at the enemy when the parties in the
trenches were being relieved.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of the garrisons of Ghuznee
and Khelat-i-Ghilzye when disastrous intelligence from the
southward reached Nott and Rawlinson at Candahar.
They had been, for some time, looking forward with the
greatest anxiety to the arrival of a convoy from Sindh,
which was to throw treasure, ammunition, hospital stores,
and other necessaries into the garrison, and increase the
number of their available troops. Brigadier England,
who commanded the Sindh field force, was at Dadur
towards the close of February, and there he received
instructions to move on through the Bolan Pass, to
assemble a strong body of troops at Quettah, and thence
to push his succours through the Kojuck with all expedient
despatch. Major Outram was then in Sindh, earnest
amongst the earnest to retrieve our lost position in
Afghanistan, and active amongst the active to carry out
the work of throwing troops into the country which had
witnessed our abasement.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> “All my endeavours in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
quarter,” he wrote on the 15th of March, “have been to
urge forward movements, and at last I have managed
to send up every disposable man. Brigadier England
marched from Dadur on the 7th (of March), and must
be at Quettah by this time. The remainder of his troops
intended for service above will march about the 23rd or
24th, so that he will have assembled at Quettah by the
end of the month (including the garrison) one troop of
European Horse Artillery, six guns; half a company of
Bombay European Artillery; Major Sotheby’s company
of Bengal European Artillery; her Majesty’s 41st Foot;
three regiments of Native Infantry and a flank battalion
of the same; two squadrons of Native Regular Cavalry,
and 200 Poonah Horse. Of the above, two regiments of
Native Infantry and half a company of artillery will be
required to garrison Quettah. All the remainder will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
available to reinforce General Nott, and will march on
Candahar with that view in the first week of April, I
trust, with everything that is required by the Candahar
garrison, namely, twenty lakhs of treasure, ammunition,
and medicines. I hope, however, that Brigadier England
will, in the mean while, push on a detachment with a
portion of these supplies to meet a brigade at the Kojuck,
which General Nott talks of sending out to receive what
can be afforded.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of March, Brigadier England arrived at
Quettah. On the following day, he wrote to Lieutenant
Hammersley, the political agent at that place: “The
22nd is at length fixed as the day of my departure from
hence, and in truth I do not see how it could advantageously
be hastened, owing to the numerous demands
made on my small means. I propose, unless other intervening
events should change such purpose, to move as
far as Hykulzye on the 24th, and there await intelligence
from the northern extremity of the Kojuck Pass. This
you must manage for me. I could move at once to Killa-Abdoollah;
but it seems to me advisable to try the
influence of our presence in the Pisheen valley, in the
matter of supplies and camels. The amount of treasure
I take to Candahar will not exceed four lakhs, and about
one-third of a lakh of musket ammunition; we have not
carriage or protection for more at a time.” On the
following day he wrote again to Lieutenant Hammersley,
stating that he was determined to halt in the Pisheen
valley, unless General Nott had actually sent two or
three regiments to the Kojuck to meet the treasure; and
Hammersley, when he forwarded a copy of this letter
to Outram, wrote that there were officers in England’s
brigade who openly prophesied that the detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
would be sacrificed between Quettah and the Kojuck
Pass.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>On the 26th of March, the Brigadier moved forward
on the Pisheen valley, taking with him five companies of
her Majesty’s 41st Regiment, six companies of Bombay
Native Infantry, a troop of the 3rd Bombay Cavalry, fifty
men of the Poonah Horse, and four Horse-Artillery guns.
Early on the 28th he “arrived at the entrance of a defile
which leads to the village of Hykulzye,” at which place
he “had intended to await the remainder of the brigade
now in progress to this place through the Bolan Pass.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
It was plain that General Nott had no intention to send
any troops to the southward to co-operate with England’s
detachment;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and it soon became apparent that the latter
would have done well to have retained his position at
Quettah until reinforced by the troops moving up from
the southward. England found himself near the village
of Hykulzye, knowing nothing about the country, and
nothing about the movements of the enemy. Colonel
Stacy accompanied the force as its political director. He
had, some days before, informed the General that he might
expect to meet the enemy at Hykulzye; but as they
approached that place no intelligence of their position
was to be obtained, and not before England was close
upon them had he any knowledge that they were in his
front. Mahomed Sadig had come down determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
dispute our progress, and was now posted, with his troops,
behind some <i>sungahs</i> on the Hykulzye heights.</p>

<p>England halted the column, and rode forward with his
staff to reconnoitre the enemy’s position. After the lapse
of about a quarter of an hour he returned, and the force
was ordered to advance. The Horse-Artillery guns were
now opened on the hills to the left, whilst Major Apthorp,
with the light battalion, was instructed to storm the hills
to the right. Leslie’s battery played with good effect,
throwing its shrapnel among the enemy; but the infantry
column was disastrously repulsed. The enemy rose up
suddenly from behind their sungahs and poured in such a
destructive fire upon our columns that the light companies
fell back. Captain May, of the 41st, was shot
dead. Major Apthorp,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> who commanded the light companies,
was carried, desperately wounded, to the rear. A
sabre-cut had laid open his skull, and another had nearly
severed his right arm. Of a party of less than 500 men
nearly a hundred were killed or wounded. The enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
fought with uncommon gallantry, and many of them were
bayoneted or shot on the hill. Among them were five or
six of their chiefs. Mahomed Sadig himself, who had
been behind the defences, but had quitted them on the
advance of our light battalion, and joined the horsemen
on the hill, received a bayonet-wound on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Our men, after their repulse, soon rallied, and were
eager again to be led to the attack. But England had
determined to retreat. Colonel Stacy volunteered to lead
a party of a hundred men up the hill and to carry the defences;
but the gallant offer was declined.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Three times
he pressed it upon the General, but with no effect. It
was believed by the latter that the Hykulzye defences
could be carried only by a strong brigade, and one, too,
equipped with mortars. So he wrote to General Nott,
urging him to send a force so equipped to meet him; and
in the mean while fell back upon Quettah.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> And there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
he began to entrench himself, as though he were about to
be besieged by an overwhelming force.</p>

<p>No satisfactory reasons have yet been assigned for this
unhappy miscarriage. But excuses have been urged in
abundance. It was alleged that the defences at Hykulzye
were impracticable&mdash;that they had been two months in
course of erection&mdash;that the General had received no plan
of them from the political authorities&mdash;that he was not,
in fact, aware of their existence&mdash;that he had been deceived
by false accounts of the number of the enemy&mdash;that
strong reinforcements had come down from Candahar&mdash;and
that the Sepoys did not support the European soldiers
at Hykulzye. But upon a careful examination of all
these charges and assertions, it does not appear that one
can be maintained.</p>

<p>The defences at Hykulzye were not formidable. General
England had not seen them at this time. Lieutenant
Evans, of the 41st, did see them; and he said that there
were “no breastworks, but merely a four-foot ditch filled
with brushwood.” The elevations were nothing more
than those heaps of earth and stone known as <i>sungahs</i>,
which may be, and often are, thrown up in a few hours.
The best information that Hammersley could obtain
went to show that these defences were thrown up by
Mahomed Sadig when General England’s force had
reached Koochlag; but not before. When the brigade
advanced from Quettah a month afterwards, the Hykulzye
defences were found to be so formidable that some of
the officers rode over them, not knowing where they
were.</p>

<p>The strength of the enemy at Hykulzye seems to have
been exaggerated very much in the same manner as the
strength of the defences. General England wrote to
Hammersley on the 28th of March, after his unsuccessful
engagement, that the enemy were “a hundred to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
stronger than any one expected.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Hammersley and
Stacy had both told the General that he might expect
Mahomed Sadig to make a stand at Hykulzye. The
former officer had computed the strength of the enemy at
1000 foot and 300 horse; and his subsequent inquiries
went to show that he had rather overstated than understated
the number actually engaged. England’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
officers estimated the strength of the enemy at from 1000
to 1300 men; and native testimony went to show that
they had overstated the number of horsemen in the field.
The strong reinforcements which were said to have come
down from Candahar before the 28th of March were
purely fabulous. There had been some talk of such a
movement, but not until after the affair with Colonel
Wymer’s brigade on the 25th of March. Then it was
debated among the chiefs whether a party should not
be sent down to the Kojuck to intercept the convoy advancing
from the southward. An invitation from Mahomed
Sadig had arrived in their camp, and it had come at
an opportune season. Greatly depressed by the failure of
their efforts in the neighbourhood of Candahar, the Douranee
chiefs were almost on the point of breaking up their
camp, when intelligence of the fall of Ghuznee came to
revive their spirits. They were then at Dehli. There
the tidings of the advance of England’s convoy reached
them, and there they received an invitation from Mahomed
Sadig to send troops to reinforce him. Expecting
that their own camp would be strengthened by the arrival
of Shumshoodeen Khan, they believed that they might
safely detach a party to the southward. Accordingly,
Saloo Khan and some other chiefs<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> set out towards the
Kojuck. But they had hardly commenced their march
when England was driven back at Hykulzye. The chiefs
fell out on the road, and Saloo Khan alone made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to the southern passes; but not a man of his party had
joined Mahomed Sadig on that disastrous 28th of March,
when England sought to justify his failure by a reference
to the reinforcements from Candahar.</p>

<p>Only one more point remains to be mentioned in connexion
with a subject which the chronicler of these events
is but too anxious to dismiss. General England insinuated
that he had no reliance upon his Sepoy troops. He is
said to have remarked, that although when his troops
and those of General Nott were united they would have
15,000 men under their command, they could not oppose
a whole nation with two weak regiments.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He thought
that her Majesty’s two regiments, the 40th and 41st,
were the only two corps that could be relied upon. Nott
told a different story. “My Sepoys are behaving nobly,”
was his constant report. I can find no mention of any
backwardness on the part of the Sepoys, in any of the
letters written by the officers of either service after the
affair at Hykulzye; and I believe, that if Colonel Stacy
had been suffered to storm the works after the first repulse,
a large number of Sepoys would have volunteered
to follow him.</p>

<p>When all the circumstances of the case come to be considered,
it appears that a disaster of a very discouraging
character was sustained by the adoption of a course which
had no object of importance commensurate with the risk
that was incurred. General England had no intention of
advancing upon Candahar. He ought, therefore, to have
remained at Quettah. The advance into the Pisheen
valley was a grave error. It was plainly England’s duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
at this time, either to have cleared the pass with the
treasure and stores which were so much needed by the
Candahar garrison, or to have waited patiently for his
reinforcements at Quettah. To advance from that place,
and then to fall back upon it, was to do that which Nott
said, in anticipation, would be more injurious to the
position of the Candahar force than 20,000 of the enemy
in the field.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Major Outram also strongly advised General
England to await at Quettah the arrival of the reinforcements
from below; but England would go on to be
beaten.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>To Nott, this failure was mortifying in the extreme.
He was in no mood to brook delays and excuses. The
disaster at Hykulzye was sufficiently annoying to him;
but the seeming unwillingness of General England to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
redeem his character by a vigorous movement in advance,
irritated him still more. He had been for some time
complaining bitterly of the neglect to which he and his
force had been subjected by the authorities below. “I
know not the intentions of Government regarding this
country,” he wrote to General England; “but this I
know and feel&mdash;that it is now from four to five months
since the outbreak at Caubul, and in all that time no
aid whatever has been given to me. I have continually
called for cavalry, for ammunition, treasure, stores, and
medicines for the sick. I have called loudly, but I have
called in vain. Had the least aid been sent&mdash;even a regiment
of cavalry&mdash;I could have tranquillised or subdued
the country. I have been tied to this important city,
when a few additional troops for its garrison would have
set me free; and I now would have moved on Ghuznee
and Caubul. All I have now to do is to uphold the
honour of my country in the best manner I can without
the assistance above alluded to, and in ignorance of the
intentions of government.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> In this frame of mind, his
patience well-nigh exhausted, his temper never of the
most genial cast now more than ever overclouded, he
received intelligence, first of England’s defeat, and then
of his reluctance to move forward. England himself
announced the latter, if not in so many plain words, in
language equally unmistakeable. After setting forth all
the dangers and difficulties of a forward movement, he
concluded, on the 10th of April, a letter to Nott by
saying: “Whenever it so happens that you retire bodily
in this direction, and that I am informed of it, I feel
assured that I shall be able to make an advantageous
diversion in your favour.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>This was too much for Nott. Determined at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
settle the question of England’s advance, he sate down
and wrote a letter to the General, declaring that he had
well considered England’s position, that he knew the
country well, that he was determined to uphold the
honour of his country, and that it was necessary that the
brigade from Quettah should push on at once with money,
medicine, and ammunition, for the relief of Candahar.
“I am well aware,” he added, with keen sarcasm, “that
war cannot be made without loss; but yet, perhaps,
the British troops can oppose Asiatic armies without
defeat.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>It was impossible to resist the urgency of this appeal.
The orders from Candahar were not to be misunderstood.
They were clear as the notes of a trumpet, and ought to
have been as spirit-stirring. England’s brigade now began
to prepare for a forward movement. So little, however,
had it been anticipated that the force would ever leave
Quettah, that the officers of the brigade had been buying
houses and settling down for cantonment life.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But on
the 26th of April, England broke ground; and on the
28th&mdash;precisely a month after the date of his disastrous
failure&mdash;was again before Hykulzye. The enemy, emboldened
by their previous success, were posted on the
ground they had occupied before; but they soon found
that they had not estimated aright the character of British
troops, and that what they had regarded as a proof of
their own superiority in the field, was an accident not
likely to be repeated. The British troops were told off
into three parties&mdash;one, under Major Simmons, to storm
the hills to the left; another, under Captain Woodburn,
to attack the hill on the right, where the disaster of the
previous month had occurred; and a third, under Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Browne, was kept in reserve. When they had taken up
their position, the guns of Leslie’s battery opened with
good effect on the enemy; and then the infantry advanced
with a loud “hurrah” to the attack. They are said to
have moved forward “as steady as on parade.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
coolness and courage of the infantry soon completed what
the admirable practice of the guns had commenced. The
enemy turned and fled. Delamaine’s cavalry were then
slipped in pursuit; and there was an end of the defence
of Hykulzye.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th, England’s brigade entered
the defile leading to the Kojuck Pass. Here, for some
unaccountable reason, the General halted the column,
dismounted from his horse, called for a chair, and sate
himself down. In vain Colonel Stacy implored him to
move on. In vain he urged that the Candahar troops
were entering the pass from the other side, and that all
the glory of the enterprise would be theirs. In vain
Major Waddington, the engineer, pressed the same advice
on the General. The Bombay force was locked-up at the
entrance to the pass, whilst Wymer, with the Bengal regiments,
was gallantly crowning the Kojuck, and reporting
everything clear for the advance of the Quettah brigade.
The Sepoys of those three noble regiments&mdash;the 2nd, the
16th, and 38th, who would have followed Wymer wheresoever
he pleased to lead them&mdash;were now climbing the
precipitous ascents, disincumbered of whatever might
clog their movements,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and every accessible height was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
bristling with the bayonets of the Candahar force. The
Bombay troops were bitterly disappointed; but they
cordially fraternised with their new comrades, and, if they
felt any pangs of envy, they were too forbearing to express
them.</p>

<p>Without any opposition the two united brigades now
marched on to Candahar, and entered the city on the
10th of May. The enemy had broken up and dispersed.
Saloo Khan, who had come down to the assistance of
Mahomed Sadig, had fallen out with that chief. He had
never thrown his heart into the cause, and was, indeed, at
any time, to be purchased by British gold. Rawlinson
thought that a little money would be well expended on
the purchase of his allegiance, but Nott objected to the
measure.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In the meanwhile, however, Stacy had been
exerting himself with good success below the Kojuck to
obtain the co-operation of this man in the important work
of keeping open the communication between Quettah and
Candahar; and when he reached the latter place, he was
able to report that Saloo Khan had promised all that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
required of him; and that Atta-oollah Khan, the brother
of the chief, was now accompanying him, for the purpose
of concluding the necessary arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Douranee chiefs, though disunited,
were not inactive. It was hard to determine with
any distinctness what were their designs at this time&mdash;so
contradictory were the accounts which reached our camp,
and so inconsistent the movements of the enemy. But it
seemed that our difficulties were very sensibly diminishing.
As the spring advanced, the general aspect of affairs was
brighter and more encouraging than it had been since the
first outbreak of the revolution. The chiefs were scattered
about in all directions&mdash;some wounded and dying&mdash;others
eager to make terms with the British. Meerza Ahmed
and Sufder Jung were contemplating a withdrawal across
the frontier to Laush and Jowayan. The latter was corresponding
with the British agent, and expressing his
desire to return to our camp. The Caubul Janbaz had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
deserted in disgust. The principal men of the surrounding
villages were sending messages into our camp, offering
to withdraw all their people from the rebel standard
if we would guarantee them against the depredations
of our troops. The trade of the <i>Ghazee</i> was plainly at a
discount. And whilst the elements of decay were thus
discernible within, there were external influences at work
to weaken the rebel cause. Glad tidings arrived from the
eastward. General Pollock had advanced upon Jellalabad;
had relieved the garrison of that place; and had,
it was said, determined to march upon the capital. A
royal salute was fired at Candahar; and as the tidings of
our successes spread through the country the spirits of the
insurgents became more and more depressed.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Still it was obvious that whilst Meerza Ahmed and
Atta Mahomed continued to flit about the neighbourhood
of Candahar, there was no prospect of permanent tranquillity.
Lesser chiefs might tender their submission, but
whilst these, the mainsprings of the great insurrectionary
movement, were employing their talents and exercising
their influence in hostility against us, there was little
chance of any effective movement for the suppression of
rebellion in Western Afghanistan. Armed with authority
from the Shah himself, granted prior to the great outbreak,
Meerza Ahmed was raising revenue in the name of
the local government, and expending the money thus
collected on the maintenance of the war. It appeared
expedient, therefore, to Nott, to cause a proclamation to be
issued, cautioning the inhabitants against paying revenue
to the Meerza. This was a measure of unquestionable
propriety; but Nott was disposed to go far beyond it.
He was eager to offer a reward to any one who would
bring in either Meerza Ahmed or Atta Mahomed to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
camp; and on the 7th of April he wrote to Rawlinson on
the subject: “I wish a proclamation to be immediately
issued, prohibiting any person paying revenue to Meerza
Ahmed or to Sufder Jung, and making them to understand,
that whatever sums they pay to these chiefs will
be their own loss, as the regular revenue due to his Majesty
the Shah will be exacted from them by the authorities of
Candahar. I will thank you in the proclamation to offer
a reward of 5000 rupees to any person who will bring in
either Meerza Ahmed or Mahomed Atta. The sooner
this is done the better. Let me see the draft of the
proclamation before it is issued.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Startled at this bold and questionable proposition,
Rawlinson, having asked in the first place whether the
proclamation was to be issued in the General’s own
name, or in that of Prince Timour, and having suggested
that on a question of such importance as that of the
raising of revenue the wishes of the Prince should be previously
ascertained, went on to speak in his letter, of the
proposed rewards. “Is the reward of 5000 rupees,” he
asked, “also offered to any one bringing in Mahomed Atta
or Meerza Ahmed, to apply to these people dead or alive,
or is it merely to be given in the event of any of the
Afghans bringing them in as prisoners? I do not think
the Prince would have any objection to issue the proclamation
about revenue, and to signify to all his subjects
that he has appointed Meerza Wulee Mahomed Khan to
the management of this department, notwithstanding he
is aware that papers of an exactly opposite tenor, issued
by his father, are in Meerza Ahmed’s hands; but I greatly
doubt his aquiescing in the subject of the reward, as whatever
may be the secret feelings of Mahomedans regarding
betrayal or assassination, it is altogether repugnant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their habits to avow such objects in a public proclamation.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>To this Nott replied that, as a matter of course, he intended
the proclamation regarding the revenue to be
issued in the name of the Prince. “In regard,” he added,
“to the reward for the apprehension of Meerza Ahmed,
that is a different thing; and if the Prince will not consent
to include it in the proclamation regarding the
revenue, where it ought to appear, I will issue a separate
proclamation. Meerza Ahmed has murdered my camp-followers
and Sepoys in the most cruel and atrocious
manner, and it is my duty, merely as commander of the
force, to offer a reward to any person who will bring him
in. Mahomed Atta has, like a monster, murdered our
officers in their houses, and cut to pieces our unarmed
and inoffensive camp-followers. I will show no mercy to
these men. My note said nothing about ‘dead or alive,’
and I thought clearly indicated bringing them in prisoners.
Why you make use of the word ‘assassination’ I know
not&mdash;but I do know that it ought not to be used by
Englishmen in any public document, and therefore it
could never enter into my mind when speaking of a proclamation.
Meerza Ahmed is collecting what he is pleased
to call revenue, to enable him to raise men to attack the
force under my command. Such plunder ought to be put
a stop to.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Then Rawlinson answered, that he regretted that the
unguarded use of the ugly word “assassination,” which
he only intended to convey the meaning which the Prince
might put upon a general offer of reward for the persons
of the proscribed chiefs, should have given any offence to
the General; but that he trusted Nott would excuse him
if he made a few remarks upon the subject of the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
proclamation. “We are accused, and perhaps suspected,”
he wrote, “of having lately suborned people to attempt
the life of Mahomed Akbar Khan; and Captain Nicolson
is known to have offered a high reward on one occasion
for the head of the Gooroo; and it would be very difficult
therefore, it appears to me, in our present proclamation,
to get the Afghans to appreciate the difference between
the offer of a reward for the betrayal of Meerza Ahmed
and Mahomed Atta into our hands, to be executed by the
Prince (as every one must know they would be) on their
arrival at Candahar, and for anticipating this sentence by
taking their lives on the spot, wherever a man might be
found bold enough to attempt the deed. Now, if any
misunderstanding on this subject existed, and we were
believed by our proclamation to be aiming at the lives
rather than at the liberty of Meerza Ahmed and Mahomed
Atta, it would be only natural for them to retaliate, and,
aided by religious enthusiasm, and with the voice of the
country in their favour, they would be far more likely, I
think, to succeed in bribing Ghazees to kill our officers,
than we would be in tempting any of the Afghans to seize
the persons of the proscribed individuals and hand them
over to us for execution. I cannot help thinking also,
that even supposing the proclamation to be expressly
stated and understood to aim only at the liberty of the
two heads of the Candahar rebellion, still it would operate
rather to our detriment than our advantage, and would
tend greatly to increase the inveteracy of our present
contest with the Afghans. It would, probably, be met by
the kidnapping of our own officers at this place, and I
suspect it would be fraught with danger to our unfortunate
countrymen in confinement at Lughman, at Caubul,
and at Ghuznee. Should you still, however, desire to
make the attempt to obtain possession of the persons of
Meerza Ahmed and Mahomed Atta, I shall be happy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
render literally into Persian any draft of a proclamation
which you will send me, and to give the proclamation all
possible publicity.”</p>

<p>The arguments of Rawlinson prevailed. But soon
another source of inquietude arose. The ex-chief of Candahar,
Kohun-dil-Khan, appeared to be again turning his
thoughts towards the government of his old principality.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
He had, ever since his expulsion from Afghanistan, been
quietly domiciliated at Shuhur-i-Babek, in the Persian
territories, between Shiraz and Kirman; but now it appeared
that he had sent an agent into Seistan to communicate
with his Candahar adherents; and was otherwise
intriguing for the recovery of the dominion he had lost.
Not without some difficulty had Rawlinson throughout
this season of convulsion contrived to maintain a recognised
system of government, in the name of Shah Soojah.
The internal administration of the country had never been
suspended; but it was only through the agency of some of
the old Barukzye functionaries that the British political
chief had succeeded, in the midst of such disturbing influences,
in carrying on the government of Western
Afghanistan. But there was little hope of his continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to exercise this influence if the old Barukzye Sirdars again
appeared on the stage. Already had Kohun-dil-Khan
sent letters to Meerza Ahmed appointing him his Wakeel
in all matters of revenue. It was even reported at one
time that the ex-Sirdars were only a few marches from
Candahar.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> These anxieties, however, were but short-lived.
After-intelligence from Persia encouraged the belief
that the Persian Government would restrain the ex-Sirdars
from crossing the frontier.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But other sources of inquietude
and annoyance soon came to take their place.
The heaviest blow of all was now about to descend upon
them. It came from the Supreme Government itself.</p>

Measures of his Administration&mdash;Departure for

Effects&mdash;The “Missing Letter”&mdash;Negotiations for the Release of
the Prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Pollock</span> and Nott were now eager to advance. On
both sides of Afghanistan a junction had been effected
which enabled the two generals to maintain a bold front
in the face of the enemy, to over-awe the surrounding
country, and to inspire with new hopes and new courage
the hearts of those whom the failures of Wild and England
had filled with despondency and alarm. The English
in India never doubted that the conduct of operations in
Afghanistan was now in the hands of men equal to the
duty which had been entrusted to them. They had full
confidence in Pollock and Nott. There were now two fine
forces of all arms, European and Native, in good health
and good spirits, eager to advance on Caubul, and sure to
carry victory before them. It seemed that the tide had
now begun to turn in our favour. As the hot weather
came on, the spirits of the Anglo-Indian community rose
with the mercury in the thermometer; everybody said
that we had seen the worst; and everybody looked for the
speedy lustration of the national honour, which had been
so hideously defiled.</p>

<p>But as the confidence of the public in the generals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
their armies rose, the confidence of the public in the man
upon whom had now devolved the great duty of shaping
the counsels of the generals, and directing the movements
of the armies, began rapidly to decline. On the 28th of
February, Lord Ellenborough had landed at Calcutta and
taken the oaths of office. The guns on the saluting battery
of Fort William roared forth their welcome to the
new Governor-General, and drowned the voices of those
who were assembling in the Town-Hall to do honour to
the departing ruler. The first intelligence of the disasters
that had overtaken our arms in the countries beyond the
Indus, had been telegraphed to him from Fort St. George,
when, standing on the deck of the <i>Cambrian</i> in the Madras
Roads, he looked out upon the white surf, the low beach,
and the dazzling houses of the southern presidency. He
arrived, therefore, at the seat of the Supreme Government
with little to learn beyond the measures which his predecessor
had sanctioned for the extrication of the emperiled
affairs of the British-Indian Empire from the thicket of
difficulty that surrounded them.</p>

<p>What those measures were it is unnecessary to repeat.
In the last letter written by Lord Auckland’s administration
to the Secret Committee&mdash;it bears date February 19,
1842&mdash;the Governor-General in Council said: “Since we
have heard of the misfortunes in the Khybur Pass, and
have been convinced that from the difficulties at present
opposed to us, and in the actual state of our preparations,
we could not expect, at least in this year, to maintain a
position in the Jellalabad districts for any effective purpose,
we have made our directions in regard to withdrawal
from Jellalabad clear and positive, and we shall rejoice to
learn that Major-General Pollock will have anticipated
these more express orders by confining his efforts to the
same objects.” And on the 24th of the same month&mdash;in
one of the last public documents of any importance written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
under the instruction of Lord Auckland&mdash;in a letter to
General Pollock, that officer is distinctly informed that
“the great present object of your proceedings at Peshawur
is, beyond the safe withdrawal of the force at Jellalabad,
that of watching events, of keeping up such communications
as may be admissible with the several parties who
may acquire power in the northern portion of Afghanistan,
of committing yourself permanently with none of these
parties, but also of declaring positively against none of
them, while you are collecting the most accurate information
of their relative strength and purposes for report to
the government, and pursuing the measures which you
may find in your power for procuring the safe return
of our troops and people detained beyond the Khybur
Pass.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> These were the parting instructions of the old
Governor-General. Lord Ellenborough found matters in
this state when he assumed the reins of office; and every
one was now eager to ascertain what measures the new
ruler would adopt.</p>

<p>The first public document of any importance to which
he attached his name was a letter to the Commander-in-Chief.
It was a letter from the Governor-General in
Council, dated the 15th of March. It was a calm and able
review of all the circumstances attending our position
beyond the Indus, and was as free from feebleness and indecision
on the one side, as it was from haste and intemperance
on the other. Lord Ellenborough at once decided that
the conduct of Shah Soojah was, at least, suspicious,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that the British Government was no longer compelled
“to peril its armies, and with its armies the Indian Empire,”
in support of the tripartite treaty. Therefore, he
said, “Whatever course we may hereafter take must rest
solely upon military considerations, and hence, in the first
instance, regard to the safety of the detached bodies of
our troops at Jellalabad, at Ghuznee, at Khelat-i-Ghilzye
and Candahar; to the security of our troops, now in the
field, from all unnecessary risk; and finally, to the re-establishment
of our military reputation by the infliction
of some signal and decisive blow upon the Afghans, which
may make it appear to them, and to our own subjects
and to our allies, that we have the power of inflicting
punishment upon those who commit atrocities and violate
their faith, and that we withdraw ultimately from Afghanistan,
not from any deficiency of means to maintain our
position, but because we are satisfied that the King we
have set up has not, as we were erroneously led to imagine,
the support of the nation over which he has been placed.”
Here, in a few sentences, was mapped out the policy recommended
by such men as Mr. Robertson and Mr. Clerk,
the policy which Pollock and Nott were eager to reduce
to action, and which, with few exceptions, the entire community
of British India were clamorously expressing their
desire to see brought into vigorous effect.</p>

<p>This letter to the Commander-in-Chief was written in
Calcutta; and it bears the signatures of the different
members of the Supreme Council of India&mdash;of Mr. Wilberforce
Bird, of General Casement, and of Mr. H. T. Prinsep.
Nothing like it was ever written afterwards. On the 6th
of April Lord Ellenborough left Calcutta. It seemed
desirable that he should be nearer to the frontier&mdash;nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to the Commander-in-Chief. The movement, at all events,
indicated an intention to act with promptitude and energy.
Already had the new Governor-General startled the sober,
slow-going functionaries of Calcutta by his restless, and, as
they thought, obtrusive activity. He seemed resolved to
see everything for himself&mdash;to do everything for himself.
Almost everything had been done wrongly by others; and
now he was going to do it rightly himself. All this
created a great convulsion in the government offices; but
out of doors, and especially in military circles, men said
that the new Governor-General was a statesman of the
right stamp&mdash;bold, vigorous, decided, thoroughly in
earnest, no fearer of responsibility&mdash;quick to conceive,
prompt to execute&mdash;just the man to meet with bold
comprehensive measures such a crisis as had now arisen.
A few sober-minded men of the old school shook their
heads, and faltered out expressions of alarm lest the
vigour of the new Governor-General should swell into
extravagance, and energy get the better of discretion.
But no one ever doubted that the leading ideas in the
Governor-General’s mind were the chastisement of the
offending Afghans and the lustration of our national
honour.</p>

<p>After a day or two spent at Barrackpore, Lord Ellenborough
put himself into a palanquin, and proceeded to
Allahabad. Halting at Benares, he addressed the Secret
Committee on the 21st of April. Much stirring intelligence
had met him as he advanced. Good and evil
were blended together in the tidings that reached him
between Calcutta and Benares. Pollock had entered the
Khybur Pass and forced his way to Ali-Musjid. Sale had
defeated Akbar Khan in a general action on the plains of
Jellalabad. But England had been beaten back at Hykulzye,
and withdrawn his brigade to Quettah. All these
things the Governor-General now reported to the Secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Committee, in a despatch which can by no means be
regarded as a model of historical truth. Writing again on
the following day to the home authorities, he stated that
he had “by no means altered his deliberate opinion that
it is expedient to withdraw the troops under Major-General
Pollock and those under Major-General Nott, at
the earliest practicable period, into positions wherein they
may have certain and easy communication with India.”
He had already written to General Nott, instructing him
to take immediate measures to withdraw the garrison of
Khelat-i-Ghilzye and evacuate Candahar. “You will
evacuate,” wrote the Chief Secretary, “the city of Candahar....
You will proceed to take up a position at
Quettah, until the season may enable you to retire upon
Sukkur. The object of the above-directed measure is to
withdraw all our forces to Sukkur at the earliest period at
which the season and other circumstances may permit
you to take up a new position there. The manner of
effecting this now necessary object is, however, left to
your discretion.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> And so the Governor-General, who in
Calcutta had determined to “re-establish our military
reputation by the infliction of some signal and decisive
blow upon the Afghans,” could now hardly write a
sentence suggestive of anything else but withdrawal and
evacuation.</p>

<p>How it happened that, within the space of little more
than a month, so great a change had come over the
counsels of the Governor-General, it would be difficult to
determine, if he himself had not furnished the necessary
explanation. “The severe check,” he wrote to the Commander-in-Chief,
“experienced by Brigadier England’s
small corps on the 28th ultimo&mdash;an event disastrous as it
was unexpected&mdash;and of which we have not yet information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to enable us to calculate all the results&mdash;has a
tendency so to cripple the before limited means of movement
and of action which were possessed by General
Nott, as to render it expedient to take immediate measures
for the ultimate safety of that officer’s corps, by
withdrawing it, at the earliest practicable period, from
its advanced position into nearer communication with
India.”</p>

<p>On this same 19th of April, the Governor-General
addressed another letter to the Commander-in-Chief,
relating to the position of General Pollock. “The only
question,” wrote the Chief Secretary, “will be, in which
position will Major-General Pollock’s force remain during
the hot months, with most security to itself, and with the
least pressure upon the health of the troops? its ultimate
retirement within the Indus being a point determined
upon, because the reasons for our first crossing the Indus
have ceased to exist.” The Commander-in-Chief was then
directed to issue his own instructions to General Pollock;
and another letter was immediately afterwards addressed
to him (the third despatched to Sir Jasper Nicolls on this
prolific 19th of April), in which, after speaking of the
withdrawal orders addressed to Pollock and Nott, the
Governor-General goes on to say: “It will, however, likewise
be for consideration whether our troops, having been
redeemed from the state of peril in which they have been
placed in Afghanistan, and it may be still hoped not
without the infliction of some severe blow upon the
Afghan army, it would be justifiable again to push them
forward for no other object than that of revenging our
losses, and of re-establishing, in all its original brilliancy,
our military character.”</p>

<p>It was Lord Ellenborough’s often-declared opinion that
“India was won by the sword, and must be maintained by
the sword.” In his despatch of the 15th of March he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had written: “In war, reputation is strength.” And yet
we now find him questioning the expediency of undertaking
operations beyond the Indus with “no other object
than that of re-establishing our military character.” If
we hold India by the sword, and reputation is strength,
a statesman need hardly look for any object beyond
the establishment of that reputation, which is the
strength by which alone our empire in India is maintained.</p>

<p>But England’s miscarriage at Hykulzye had not only
driven all the forward feeling out of Lord Ellenborough,
but had blunted his logical acumen and deadened all his
feelings of compassion. He seems to have forgotten that
at this time there was a party of English prisoners in the
hands of the Afghans&mdash;that the generals who had commanded
our army at Caubul&mdash;the widow of the murdered
Envoy&mdash;the brave-hearted wife of the commander of the
illustrious garrison of Jellalabad&mdash;the man who had
rescued Herat from the grasp of the Persian, and done the
only thing that had yet been done to roll back from the
gates of India the tide of Western invasion&mdash;with many
more brave officers and tender women, were captives in
the rude fortresses of the Afghan Sirdars. The Governor-General
seems to have forgotten that there were prisoners
to be rescued; and he doubted the expediency of undertaking
operations merely for the re-establishment of our
military reputation&mdash;although upon that reputation, in
his own opinion, our tenure of India depended.</p>

<p>The request conveyed to Sir Jasper Nicolls in the
government letter of the 19th of April met with prompt
compliance; and on the 29th, the Commander-in-Chief,
who was then at Simlah, instructed General Pollock to
withdraw every British soldier from Jellalabad to Peshawur.
“The only circumstances,” he added, “which can authorise
delay in obeying this order, are: 1st. That you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
brought a negotiation for the release of the prisoners
lately confined at Budeeabad to such a point that you
might risk its happy accomplishment by withdrawing.
2ndly. That you may have attached a lightly equipped
force to rescue them. 3rdly. That the enemy at Caubul
may be moving a force to attack you. In this improbable
case, should any respectable number of troops have
descended into the plain below Jugdulluck with that
intent, it would be most advisable to inflict such a blow
upon them as to make them long remember your parting
effort.” Of these instructions the Governor-General
“entirely approved;” and on the 6th of May the Chief
Secretary wrote to General Pollock, saying: “They
are in accordance with the general principles laid down
by his Lordship for your guidance, and you will execute
them to the best of your ability, having regard always
to the health of your troops and to the efficiency of your
army.”</p>

<p>In the interval, however, between the 19th of April
and the 6th of May, the Governor-General having somewhat
shaken off the uneasy sensation which the disaster
at Hykulzye seems to have engendered in his mind, and
having arrived at the conclusion that the phantoms
which had so intimidated him had not struck terror into
the brave heart of General Pollock, had written to the
General, anticipating the possibility of his having advanced
upon Caubul.</p>

<p>“The aspect of affairs in Upper Afghanistan,” wrote
the Chief Secretary, on the 28th of April, “appears to be
such, according to the last advices received by the
Governor-General, that his Lordship cannot but contemplate
the possibility of your having been led, by the
absence of serious opposition on the part of any army in
the field, by the divisions amongst the Afghan chiefs, and
by the natural desire you must, in common with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
true soldier, have of displaying again the British flag in
triumph upon the scene of our late disasters, to advance
upon and occupy the city of Caubul. If that event should
have occurred, you will understand that it will in no
respect vary the view which the Governor-General previously
took of the policy now to be pursued. The
Governor-General will adhere to the opinion that the only
safe course is that of withdrawing the army under your
command, at the earliest practicable period, into positions
within the Khybur Pass, where it may possess easy and
certain communications with India.” Why Lord Ellenborough
should have entertained a belief even of the
possibility of Pollock advancing upon Caubul, in the face
of positive instructions to the contrary and a known
deficiency of carriage, it is not easy to conjecture. Probably
Lord Ellenborough himself could not have explained
the source of this extraordinary buoyancy of expectation,
for six days afterwards he declared that he had been led
to expect “that you (Pollock) will have already decided
upon withdrawing your troops within the Khybur Pass,
into a position wherein you may have easy and certain
communication with India, if considerations, having
regard to the health of the army, should not have induced
you to defer that movement.” The idea of the advance
upon Caubul seems only to have been a temporary
apprehension arising out of a not erroneous estimate
of the military aspirations of General Pollock; and it
very soon passed away. But it had one important result.
It called forth from the General the following soldierly
letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1 lmid">TO T. H. MADDOCK, ESQ., SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, ETC.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">Jellalabad, May 13, 1842.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Sir.</span></p>

<p class="phb">I had the honour to forward with my letter No. 32, dated
12th instant, a copy of a letter from his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief.
I have now the honour to acknowledge the receipt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
your letter, dated 28th ultimo, which adverts to the present aspect
of affairs in Afghanistan, and the probability of my having advanced
towards Caubul; stating also, that in such an event, the views of
the Governor-General as to the withdrawal of the troops will not
be altered; and further, that whatever measures I may adopt I
must have especial regard to the health of the troops. I trust that
I am not wrong in considering this letter as leaving to me discretionary
powers, and, coming as it does from the supreme power in
India, I venture to delay, for some days, acting up to the instructions
communicated in his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief’s
letter, dated 29th ult.</p>

<p>I regret much that a want of carriage-cattle has detained me
here; if it had not been so, I should now be several marches in
advance, and I am quite certain that such a move would have been
highly beneficial. Affairs at Caubul are, at the present moment, in
a very unsettled state; but a few days must decide in favour of one
of the parties. Mahomed Akbar is at Caubul, exerting all his
influence to overpower the Prince. He is without means; and if
he cannot, within a very short period obtain the ascendancy, he
must give up the contest, in which case I have no doubt I shall
hear from him again. With regard to our withdrawal at the
present moment, I fear that it would have the very worst effect&mdash;it
would be construed into a defeat, and our character as a powerful
nation would be entirely lost in this part of the world.</p>

<p>It is true that the garrison of Jellalabad has been saved, which
it would not have been, had a force not been sent to its relief.
But the relief of that garrison is only one object; there still remain
others which we cannot disregard&mdash;I allude to the release of the
prisoners. I expect about nineteen Europeans from Budeeabad in
a few days. The letters which have passed about other prisoners
have already been forwarded for the information of his Lordship.
If, while these communications were in progress, I were to retire, it
would be supposed that a panic had seized us. I therefore think
that our remaining in this vicinity (or perhaps a few marches in
advance) is essential to uphold the character of the British nation;
and in like manner General Nott might hold his post; at all events
till a more favourable season.</p>

<p>I have no reason, yet, to complain that the troops are more unhealthy
than they were at Agra. If I am to march to Peshawur,
the climate is certainly not preferable; and here I can in one or
two marches find a better climate, and I should be able to dictate
better terms than I could at Peshawur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot imagine any force being sent from Caubul which I could
not successfully oppose. But the advance on Caubul would require
that General Nott should act in concert and advance also. I therefore
cannot help regretting that he should be directed to retire,
which, without some demonstration of our power, he will find some
difficulty in doing. I have less hesitation in thus expressing my
opinion, because I could not under any circumstances, move in less
than eighteen or twenty days; and your reply might reach me by
express in about twenty-two days. The difference in point of time
is not very material, but the importance of the subject is sufficient
to justify the delay of a few days. In the mean time, I shall
endeavour to procure carriage-cattle as fast as I can, to move either
forward or backward, as I may be directed; or, if left to my discretion,
as I may think judicious. Under any circumstances, I should
not advocate the delay of the troops either at Candahar or on this
side beyond the month of November; and in this arrangement
advertence must be had to the safety of the Khybur, which I consider
the Sikhs would gladly hold if they were allowed to take
possession of Jellalabad.</p>

<p class="pr6">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">George Pollock</span>, Major-Gen.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Unwilling to return to the provinces without striking a
signal blow at the Afghans, and doing something great
to re-establish the military reputation of Great Britain in
the countries beyond the Indus, Pollock grasped eagerly
at the faintest indication of willingness on the part of the
Governor-General to place any discretionary power in his
hands; and expressed his eagerness to traverse, with a
victorious army, the scene of our recent humiliation. If
he had had carriage he would have advanced at once;
but the want of cattle paralysed the movements of the
force, and kept Pollock inactive in the neighbourhood of
Jellalabad. In one respect this want was a gain and an
advantage. Mindful both of the honour of his country,
and of the safety of his captive countrymen and countrywomen,
Pollock adroitly turned the scarcity of carriage to
good account, by declaring that he had not the means of
retiring to Peshawur. Thus gaining time for something
to be written down in the chapter of accidents, he continued
to maintain his advanced position, and exerted
himself to secure by negotiation the release of the
prisoners from the hands of Akbar Khan.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean while, the announcement of the Governor-General’s
determination to withdraw the troops from their
advanced positions had reached Candahar. Nott had
always consistently declared that he would not yield an
inch of ground without the instructions of the Supreme
Government, but that, fortified by such instructions, he
was prepared to move either in one direction or the other&mdash;to
abandon all the posts in Western Afghanistan, or to
march victoriously on the capital. He had his own
opinions on the subject of withdrawal; but the obedience
of the soldier was paramount over all his words and
actions; and when he received the instructions of which
mention has been made, he wrote to the Chief Secretary
on the 17th of May: “These measures shall be carried
into effect, and the directions of his Lordship accomplished
in the best manner circumstances will admit of.” And
again he wrote on the 21st to the same functionary: “I
shall not lose a moment in making all necessary arrangements
for carrying into effect the orders I have received,
without turning to the right or to the left, by the idle
propositions and wild speculations daily and hourly heaped
upon me from all parts of Afghanistan and Sindh, by persons
who are, or fancy themselves to be, representatives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
government West of the Indus. I know that it is my duty
and their duty implicitly and zealously to carry into effect
every order received, without inquiring into the reasons
for the measures adopted, whatever our own opinions or
wishes may be, and without troubling government with
unnecessary references.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> But it was plain that he read
the orders of the Supreme Government not without acute
mortification. He yielded in effect a prompt assent;
but in spirit it was a grudging one. The orders for
the evacuation of Candahar took Nott and Rawlinson
by surprise, and filled them with as much pain as
astonishment. What was really felt by the Candahar
authorities is not to be learnt from the published
papers; but in the following letter written by Rawlinson
to Outram on the 18th of May, not only are the
real feelings of the military and political chiefs clearly
revealed, but the probable effects of the evacuation
of Candahar sketched out, with a free hand by the
latter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="phb p1">The peremptory order to retire has come upon us like a
thunder-clap. No one at Candahar is aware of such an order having
been received, except the General and myself, and we must preserve
a profound secrecy as long as possible. The withdrawal of the
garrison from Kelat-i-Ghilzye and the destruction of the fortifications
at that place must, I fancy, however, expose our policy, and
our situation will then be one of considerable embarrassment.</p>

<p>General Nott intends, I believe, to order all the carriage at
Quettah to be sent on to Candahar. A regiment is to escort the
camels laden with grain to Killah Abdoolah, where the troops
will remain in charge of the depôt, and from whence a regiment or
two regiments detached from this will bring on the camels empty
to Candahar. It must be our object to collect carriage, on the
pretext of an advance on Caubul; but how long the secret can be
kept, it is impossible to say. When our intended retirement is once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
known, we must expect to have the whole country up in arms, and
to obtain no cattle except such as we can violently lay hands on.</p>

<p>If the worst comes to the worst, we must abandon all baggage
and stores, and be content to march with sufficient food to convey
us to Quettah, for which I believe the carriage now available will
suffice.</p>

<p>It will be quite impossible to destroy the works of Candahar,
as directed in the government letter: the worst that can be done is
to blow up the gateways. I have hardly yet had time to reflect
fully upon the effects, immediate and prospective, of our abrupt
departure. There is no man at present on whom I can cast my
eyes in all Candahar as likely to succeed to power. Sufder Jung
will be a mere puppet of course, and will be liable to deposition at
any moment. Should the Barukzyes triumph at Caubul, and
should we no longer oppose the return of Kohundil, he will be the
most likely chief to succeed; but the natural consequence of his
return, and of our determined non-interference with the affairs in
this quarter, will be of course to render Persian influence paramount
at Herat and Candahar; and, with the prospect of a Russian
fleet at Astrabad and a Persian army at Merve, it is by no means
impossible that the designs which threatened us in 1838 may at
last be directly accomplished. Strong measures of intimidation,
both against Russia and Persia, will be our best protection.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">But, however great may have been the mortification
which Nott and Rawlinson were now condemned to experience,
the orders of the Supreme Government were so
explicit, that the General believed it to be his duty at
once to begin to carry them into effect. A brigade had
already been equipped for the relief of Khelat-i-Ghilzye
and the rescue of the Ghuznee prisoners. It was now
despatched, on the 19th of May, to bring off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
garrison, and to destroy the works of the former place.
Colonel Wymer commanded the force. It consisted of
those three noble Sepoy regiments with which he had
before done such good service;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> her Majesty’s 40th
Regiment, Leslie’s troop of Horse Artillery, four guns
of Blood’s battery, the Bombay cavalry details, and
the Shah’s 1st Regiment of Horse. Some troopers of
Haldane’s cavalry, some details of Bengal artillery, and
of the Madras sappers, completed the components of
the force.</p>

<p>Thus, in the later weeks of May, Pollock was holding
his post at Jellalabad, eager to receive authority to march
upon Caubul, and rejoicing in the pretext of a scarcity of
carriage for delaying the withdrawal of his force; Nott,
eager, too, for a forward movement, but unable to perceive
in the instructions of government the least indication
of an intention to place any discretionary power in his
hands, was taking measures to secure, with all promptitude,
the accomplishment of their wishes; and the
Governor-General, from Allahabad, was writing strong
letters to the Generals, impressing upon them the
necessity of maintaining a discreet silence regarding the
intentions of government and the future movements of
the troops.</p>

<p>There was nothing, in truth, more desirable than this.
The intentions of the Governor-General were of such a
character as to render these revelations, in the existing
state of things, dangerous, if not fatal, to the interests of
Great Britain in the countries beyond the Indus. But
official secrets are not easily kept in a country where so
many copies of every public letter are forwarded to
different authorities, in distant parts of the country;
where so many clerks are employed to copy, and so many
staff-officers allowed to read them. Before the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
May it was known, not only in General Pollock’s camp,
but in all the cantonments of India, that the armies were
to be withdrawn. The secret had welled out from the
bureau of the Commander-in-Chief; and bets were made
at the mess-tables of Jellalabad regarding the probable
date of the withdrawal of the troops. No man knew
better than Pollock the danger of such revelations,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and
he did his best to counteract the evil tendency of the
reports which were now the common gossip of his camp,
and were soon likely to be current in all the Afghan
bazaars. “I have taken steps,” he wrote to the Commander-in-Chief,
“to prevent any great mischief resulting,
by ordering the deputy-quarter-master-general a few miles
in advance, to mark out a new encamping ground; and I
shall have such inquiries made among the natives about
bringing supplies there, that will make them believe that
I shall move forward.”</p>

<p>And Pollock still hoped that something might arise to
wring from the Governor-General an order to march upon
the Afghan capital. But the letters he received from Lord
Ellenborough and Sir Jasper Nicolls were calculated not
only to discourage but to embarrass him. There was no
possibility of misunderstanding the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief;
but the Governor-General, whilst
imperatively directing the speediest possible withdrawal
of Pollock’s army, was every now and then throwing
out a hint that a forward movement for the chastisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of the Afghans would not be ungrateful to
him. And whilst the Governor-General was obviously
intending to place some discretionary power in the
General’s hands, the Commander-in-Chief was writing to
assure him that the orders of the Supreme Government
all tended towards an immediate and unconditional withdrawal.</p>

<p>The letter of the 13th of May elicited no answer; but
a letter written a week afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in which Pollock
pointed out the evils and difficulties of an immediate
withdrawal to Peshawur, found the Governor-General in
one of his more forward and chivalrous moods. Pollock, in
this letter of the 20th of May, had said: “I shall be glad
if any letter from government may authorise my remaining
till October or November;” and now, on the 1st of
June, the Governor-General, through the Chief Secretary,
replied: “It would be desirable, undoubtedly, that before
finally quitting Afghanistan, you should have an opportunity
of striking a blow at the enemy; and since circumstances
seem to compel you to remain there till October,
the Governor-General earnestly hopes that you may be
enabled to draw the enemy into a position in which you
may strike such a blow effectually.” And again, in the
same letter: “It will be for your consideration whether
your large army, one half of which would beat, in open
field, everything that could be brought against it in
Afghanistan, should remain entirely inactive during the
period which must now apparently elapse before it can
finally retire. Although you may not have, or soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
able to procure the means of moving your whole army,
you may possibly be able to move a part of it rapidly
against some portion of the enemy’s force incautiously
exposed, and of giving it a severe blow.” This was, at all
events, something gained. And the gain was a sudden
one. Only three days before, the Governor-General, in a
letter to Pollock, had resented the presumption of Mr.
Clerk in drawing from a former letter an inference in
favour of the continued occupation of Jellalabad, in the
event of negotiations being on foot for the release of the
prisoners, and had expressed a strong opinion that no
negotiations had yet been entered upon of a nature to
impede the backward movement of the force. The letter
of the 1st of June was, therefore, doubly welcome. Pollock
had now received a constructive permission to remain at
Jellalabad until October;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and, as every effort was to
be made in the interval to collect carriage-cattle in the
provinces of Hindostan, ostensibly for the purpose of his
withdrawal from Afghanistan, he determined to lose no
opportunity of turning those means of withdrawal to
the best possible account. If there were carriage to
enable him to fall back upon Peshawur, there would be
carriage to enable him to advance upon Caubul, for the
mistake of hiring cattle, with local limitations affixed to
the engagements, was not to be perpetuated. So General
Pollock looked forward with confidence to the coming
autumn, as to a time when a vigorous and decisive blow
might be struck at the nation which had humbled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
pride and defiled the honour of the conquerors of
Hindostan.</p>

<p>Patiently, therefore, biding his time, Pollock turned the
halt at Jellalabad to the best possible account, by endeavouring
to obtain by negotiation the ransom of the British
prisoners. What those negotiations were, and what was
their result, should be stated in this place. It was on the
evening of the 25th of April that some excitement was
created in Pollock’s camp at Jellalabad, by rumours, presently
confirmed, of the arrival of Captain Colin Mackenzie,
one of the prisoners in the hands of Akbar Khan, with a
letter from Major Pottinger, and overtures from the Sirdar.
Pottinger’s letter briefly shadowed forth the terms on
which Akbar Khan and his Ghilzye confederates were
prepared to release the prisoners&mdash;but the language employed
was rather that of inquiry than dictation. “The
Sirdar,” wrote Pottinger, “wishes to know, in the first
place, if we will consent to withdraw the greater part of
our troops, and leave an agent with a small body of men
to act with whomever the confederates may elect as chief,
in which case they propose to be guided by the wishes of
the two factions in Caubul, and wish us to release Dost
Mahomed Khan. <i>Secondly</i>&mdash;They propose, that if the
British Government have determined on subjecting the
country and continuing the war, that the prisoners at
present in Afghanistan shall be exchanged for Dost Mahomed
Khan, his family and attendants, and that the issue
be dependent on the sword. <i>Thirdly</i>&mdash;In the event of
neither of these propositions being approved of, they wish
to know what terms will be granted to themselves individually;
whether we, in the event of their submission,
will confine them, send them to India, take hostages from
them, reduce their pay, or, in short, what they have to
expect from our clemency.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>To this General Pollock replied, that “kindness and
good treatment of our prisoners would meet with due consideration
at the hands of the British Government, and
the release of them much more so; that if money were a
consideration, he was prepared to pay into the hands of
any one the Sirdar might depute to receive it the sum of
two lakhs of rupees, whenever the prisoners might be
delivered into his hands;” and that Mahomed Shah
Khan and his brothers would be “suffered to enjoy the
advantages arising from their hereditary dominions.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>With this letter Mackenzie left Jellalabad on the evening
of the 28th of April. He had been instructed by the
Sirdar to ascertain, if possible, from General Pollock
whether there was any chance of the British Government
admitting him to terms, on his own account, if he would
detach himself from the national cause, and exert his
influence to advance our interests in Afghanistan. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
upon this Pollock could express no definite opinion. “His
position,” wrote the General to the Supreme Government,
“is evidently different from the others. That he was the
murderer of the Envoy there cannot be a question, and he
evidently feels his guilt to be an insuperable bar to any
terms from us; but he also feels that he has possession of
the persons of our countrymen, and that circumstance
seems to hold out to him a hope that his proffers of submission
will meet with a favourable reception.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The reply of General Pollock to the overtures of Akbar
Khan disappointed the Sirdar; and Captain Mackenzie
was again despatched to Jellalabad. This time he was
the bearer of a string of proposals far more extravagant
than those which had been conveyed by him on his first
mission. The requests of the Barukzye chief, as set forth
in Pottinger’s letter to the General, were&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1stly. That a written promise of amnesty be given to himself,
Mohamed Shah Khan, and the latter’s family, for all past acts up
to the date of delivery. 2ndly. That neither he nor any of the
above-mentioned family shall be sent out of the Caubul and
Jellalabad districts against their wishes. 3rdly. That they may
not be obliged to pay their respects to you in our camp till they
be assured against any danger. 4thly. If we merely intend to
revenge ourselves on the enemy, and then leave the country, he
trusts its government will be conferred on him. 5thly. He wants
a jaghire to support his family, and he names two lakhs as
adequate. 6thly. He wants eight lakhs of rupees as a present to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
start him with. (His great fear, as it is of all Afghans, is of being
removed from his country.) He also asks for his own women, who
are in his father’s <i>harem-serai</i>. They have asked for the money, if
it is paid, to be given to Sir-Bolund Khan, who will remain as a
hostage till the prisoners are delivered, or that you pay it to
Hindoos, who can empower their agents in Caubul to pay it on
delivery of the prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p class="p1">To these proposals Pollock replied:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">With regard to the first, it follows as a matter of course that,
whenever we agree to any terms, amnesty for the past will result.</p>

<p>The second request, about residing at Caubul and Jellalabad, is
out of place now; it must depend upon contingencies, and be discussed
only after other and more important points have been
agreed upon.</p>

<p>With reference to the third request, the Sirdar Mahomed Akbar
may be assured that I would guarantee his personal safety whenever
he may visit my camp; but his doing so would require some preliminary
arrangement, unless he voluntarily claims our protection,
in which case I could immediately arrange for his safety, and appeal
to the government on his behalf.</p>

<p>The fourth request refers to matters entirely depending on
future results, and which are known to God alone. It would
therefore be vain to speculate on them at this stage of our negotiation.</p>

<p>With regard to the fifth and sixth requests, I have already told
you that I suppose the Sirdar rests his claim to any present on
his delivering up the prisoners, which, as I have before stated,
will be the best evidence of good faith, and a sincere wish for
favourable terms with the British Government. I have accordingly
already mentioned the sum of two lakhs of rupees. The
Sirdar Mahomed Akbar must recollect that he is desirous of
obtaining the females of his own family. The British Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
will not require any money to be paid on their account; and I
hereby guarantee that, on all the prisoners being delivered over to
me, I will write to India for the women of the Sirdar Mahomed
Akbar, and I have no doubt that my request will be complied with.</p>

<p>As to the payment of the money for the prisoners now with, or
in the power of Mahomet Akbar, it shall be made to any person
the Sirdar may appoint to receive it, or it shall be paid to Hindoos
who can give bills on Caubul. The good faith and honour of the
British nation is not doubted, and I therefore hereby pledge myself
to pay the two lakhs of rupees on account of government whenever
the prisoners are made over to me.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Mackenzie took his departure with these replies. There
was stirring work, at this time, for Akbar Khan at Caubul;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and the negotiations had no result. But the visits of the
British officer to Jellalabad had not been without their
uses. Mackenzie had been the bearer of much information
of the deepest interest, and had placed many valuable
documents in the hands of General Pollock. The General
had laid before him a string of questions relative to the
causes and progress of the insurrection at Caubul, the
answers to which, in the existing state of information even
in the best-informed quarters, threw a flood of light upon
many dark points of recent history. And whilst in official
places many important revelations were made, all through
the general camp there transpired, in time, from the same
source, much that was eagerly sought, eagerly discussed
when found, and eagerly transmitted to every cantonment
in India, where the fate of the captives in the hands of
Akbar Khan was a matter of the liveliest concernment,
and a source of the most painful alarm.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[January-April: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Captivity&mdash;Surrender of the Married Families&mdash;Their Journey to
Tezeen&mdash;Proceed to Tugree&mdash;Interviews between Pottinger and
Akbar Khan&mdash;Removal to Budeeabad&mdash;Prison Life&mdash;Removal to
Zanda&mdash;Death of General Elphinstone.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Few</span> were the letters which Mackenzie brought from
his fellow-captives to their friends at Jellalabad. There
may have been state reasons for the secrecy which enveloped
his movements; but to all parties the disappointment
was great. Every one at Jellalabad was eager for
intelligence regarding the incidents which had befallen the
little band of prisoners, and for particulars of all the daily
environments of their captive state. All through the
camp ran eager inquiries; and little by little the much-coveted
information began to radiate from the General’s
tent, and to diffuse itself in more remote quarters. What
was then told in mere outline may here be given more in
detail.</p>

<p>It was on the 9th of January that the married families
were made over to the protection of Mahomed Akbar
Khan. The following day was spent by them in a small
fort, where they found Pottinger, Lawrence, and Mackenzie,
who had been surrendered as hostages at Boot-Khak.
Rude as was the accommodation, and untempting as was
the fare, that were here offered them, after the miseries
and privations of the retreat through the snowy passes,
the “small dark hovels” in which they were crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
together were a very palace, and the “greasy palao” in
which they dipped their fingers was regal fare. They
slept that night on the bare ground&mdash;but there was a
roof between them and the open sky; and they thought
little of the smoke, which almost suffocated them,
whilst in the enjoyment of the reviving warmth of a
wood fire.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th, through scenes of unexampled
horror, the party of captives were conducted to
the Tezeen fort. The road was strewn with the stark
bodies of the mangled dead. Here and there little
groups of wretched camp-followers, starving, frost-bitten,
many of them in a state of gibbering idiocy, were to be
seen cowering in the snow; or solitary men, perhaps
wounded and naked, were creeping out of their hiding-places,
in an extremity of mortal suffering and fear. The
sickening smell of death rose from the bloody corpses
through which our English ladies guided their horses,
striving not to tread upon the bodies, or in their
camel-panniers jolted and stumbled over the obstructing
carrion. Happy were they all, when, about the hour of
evening prayer, that dreadful journey was at an end,
and the fort of Tezeen appeared in sight. There they
were hospitably received&mdash;and there another captive was
added to their number. Lieutenant Melville, of the
54th Native Infantry, who had been wounded on the
retreat, and whose wounds had been bound up by the
hand of Akbar Khan himself, was waiting their arrival
in the fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day they were carried to Seh-Baba;
and the same dreadful scenes of carnage sickened them
as they went along. On the march another prisoner, and
a welcome one, was added to the party&mdash;one whom the
sick and wounded had much wanted&mdash;a medical officer,
Dr. Macgrath. On the 13th, partly over remote mountain
paths, so precipitous that the camels could scarcely
keep their footing, and partly along the bloody track
of our slaughtered army, the captive band were escorted
to Jugdulluck. Here three ragged tents had been
pitched for their reception. Here they found General
Elphinstone, Brigadier Shelton, and Captain Johnson,
who had been claimed as hostages by Akbar Khan; and
here they learnt that all the soldiers and camp-followers
who had left Caubul, with the exception of this little
handful of prisoners, had, in all probability, been annihilated
on the march.</p>

<p>Next morning they resumed their journey&mdash;the General,
the Brigadier, and Captain Johnson, accompanied
by Akbar Khan, bringing up the rear. A more rugged
and difficult road had seldom been travelled over. The
ascents and descents were seemingly impracticable; it
made the travellers giddy to look at them. The road
was “one continuation of rocks and stones, over which
the camels with the greatest difficulty scrambled” with
their burdens.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> At night they bivouacked on the banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of the Punshuhur river. There were no tents, no shelter
of any kind for the ladies. So they rolled themselves up in
their warmest garments, laid their heads upon their saddles,
and composed themselves, as best they could, to sleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 15th of January, they
crossed the deep and rapid fords of the Punshuhur river.
The passage was not accomplished without difficulty
and danger; but the active kindness of the Afghan
Sirdars availed to escort the party over in safety.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A
bitterly cold wind was blowing as they passed; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
few followers and cattle were lost. Proceeding then in
a north-easterly direction, they made their way over a
barren, inhospitable country, where neither grass nor
water was to be seen, into the fertile valley of Lughman;
and halted in the vicinity of the Tugree fort.
The following day was the Sabbath. A day’s halt had
been determined upon; and it fell, by a happy accident,
on the Christian’s day of rest. A Bible and Prayer-book
had been “picked up on the field at Boot-Khak;” and
the service of the Church of England was read to the
little band of prisoners. It is easy to imagine with what
deep emotion they must have joined in the prayer beseeching
the Almighty to have mercy “upon all prisoners
and captives.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, they were again upon the
move.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Tugree is only thirty miles distant from Jellalabad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and up to this time a faint hope had been encouraged
by the captives that they were to be escorted to
that place. But now an order came for them “to prepare
for a march higher up the valley,” and in a different
direction. It was now found that their destination was
the fort of Budeeabad. This was to be their resting-place.
It had been recently erected; and was the property of
Mahomed Shah Khan, the father-in-law of the Sirdar.
Five rooms, composing two sides of an inner square, or
citadel, were allotted to the British prisoners. The
buildings were “intended for the chief and his favourite
wife,”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and it may therefore be presumed that they
afforded the best accommodation in the place. The party
consisted of nine ladies, twenty gentlemen, and fourteen
children. Seventeen European soldiers, two European
women, and a child, were located in another part of
the fort.</p>

<p>On that night of the 17th of January, Pottinger and
Akbar Khan were in close and earnest conversation. The
Sirdar entered on the subject of his father’s release; and
asked the English officer if he would guarantee an interchange
of prisoners and the evacuation of Jellalabad.
Pottinger could only answer that he was a prisoner and
powerless; and could give no promises with any certainty
of their being performed. But he undertook to write to
Macgregor on the subject; and to urge him to lay the
wishes of the Sirdar before the Supreme Government.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
It appeared to Pottinger that no more expedient course
could be adopted than that involving a general interchange
of prisoners and the restoration of the country to
Dost Mahomed Khan.</p>

<p>Ostensibly for the purpose of proceeding southward for
the reduction of Jellalabad, Akbar Khan took his departure
on the following day; and the captives began to
settle down into the monotony of prison-life. In this
place they continued to reside for nearly three months.
The incidents of captivity, during this period, were not
many, or very memorable. Here for the first time, after
the lapse of a fortnight, they were able to change their
clothes.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Clean linen was very scarce; and the nice sensibilities
of delicate English ladies were outraged by the
appearance of nauseous vermin. The food that was served
out to them was not of the most luxurious description. It
consisted of rice, mutton, and thick cakes of unleavened
dough, prepared by the Afghan cooks in a manner little
relished by English palates.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Captain Lawrence acted
as the steward of the captive party, and divided the supplies,
whether they were the daily food of the prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
or parcels of clothes, money,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and other equally acceptable
presents sent them either by their Afghan captors or their
friends at Jellalabad.</p>

<p>There was nothing very painful in the outward circumstances
of their captivity, except the unmitigated dirt,
which the cleanly habits of the English in India must
have rendered peculiarly offensive. They were not
suffered to wander far from their prison-house; but within
its walls they found both occupation and amusement, and
the time passed at Budeeabad is not now, in the retrospect,
the saddest of their lives. They had among them
a few books; some had been brought for sale by natives
of the country, who had picked them up on the road
traversed by the army on its retreat; others had been
forwarded by friends at Jellalabad. Now and then a
stray newspaper came in from that place. It is hard to
say how greedily its contents were devoured, and how
eagerly they were discussed. Sometimes letters were
received from below; there was a good deal of cypher
correspondence between the prisoners and Sale’s garrison,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
and many long letters were written to friends in India or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in England, to be despatched when opportunity might
offer. Then there were amongst them two or three packs
of old playing cards&mdash;dirty and limp, but not the less
serviceable for these conventional defects. Some rude
backgammon and draft boards had been constructed for
prison service; and there was quite enough elasticity of
spirits left among the captives to render them not disinclined
for more active and boisterous sports. They played
at “hop-scotch;” they played at “blind-man’s buff.” A
favourite game among them was the latter; and when
some ten or fifteen healthy and cheerful little boys and
girls joined in the sport, the mirth ran fast and furious.
A Christmas party in old England seldom sees madder
gambols than these&mdash;seldom has the heart’s laughter risen
more freely from a band of merrier children than those
who romped with their elders in prison at Budeeabad.
But from those elders were seldom absent the memory of
the harrowing past, painful apprehensions regarding the
future, and, above all, a depressing sense of the national
humiliation.</p>

<p>The Sabbaths were always kept holy. Every Sunday
saw the little party of Christian prisoners assembled for
the worship of their God. Sometimes in the open air,
sometimes in tents, in huts, or any other place available
for the purpose, Sunday after Sunday, the Church Service
was read to as devout a band of worshippers as ever
assembled to render thanks to the Almighty, and to
implore the continuance of His mercies. Nor were these
observances lost upon their guards. Wild and savage as
were their keepers, they seemed to respect the Christians’
day of rest. There was more decorum in their demeanour,
more courtesy in their manner, than on the working-days
of the week. An atmosphere of peace and rest seemed to
envelop them on that sacred day. Some, who had saved
little else, had saved their Bibles, and every evening little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
knots of captives might have been heard in their cells,
lifting up the voice of prayer, and reading to one another
God’s blessed promises to the heavy-laden and the
afflicted.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January, Akbar Khan, accompanied by
Sooltan Jan, returned to Budeeabad. The object of his
visit was to induce Pottinger to write to Macgregor at
Jellalabad, stating the terms on which the Sirdar was
willing to treat with the British for the release of the
prisoners. The letter was duly written;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> but Pottinger
repeated that he had no hope of the surrender of Jellalabad;
and added that he advised the Sirdar not to attack
it lest a war should be commenced of which it was difficult
to see the end. Pottinger believed that the Sirdar was
sincere in his expressions of a desire to establish friendly
relations with the British. “But,” he added, “he has
been brought up in the midst of treachery, and does not
know how to trust; and I regret that our own conduct
in this country has put our government’s faith on a par
with themselves. Our defeat, though sufficiently galling
to a soldier, really loses its sting when the taunts of our
broken promises, which we know to be true, are thrown
in our teeth by men who know the truth only by name.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>About the middle of the month of February the captive
party was increased by the arrival of Major Griffiths and
Captain Souter; and a few days afterwards, the same terrific
earthquake which had shaken down the ramparts of
Jellalabad made the walls of their prison-house reel and
totter, and levelled a portion of the fort with the dust.
For many days lesser shocks of earthquake kept the people
in a continued state of alarm. The prisoners slept in the
open court-yard, which was filled with their beds; and all
kinds of rude awnings were thrown up to secure a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
privacy. The cold was intense, and the heavy dews saturated
the bedding like rain. No lives were sacrificed
within the fort by this great convulsion of nature; but
narrow was the escape of Lady Sale, Brigadier Shelton,
Captain Mackenzie, Mr. Eyre, and General Elphinstone.
The first four were on the house-top when the shock commenced;
and had scarcely time to secure a footing on a
safer spot when the roof fell in with a crash. The poor
old General was bed-ridden. His sufferings had been
every day increasing. He had been wounded on the retreat.
His constitutional infirmities had been aggravated
both by the external hardships to which he had been subjected,
and the corroding anxieties which had preyed upon
his mind. It was plain to all that his end was approaching.
But he bore his accumulated sufferings with heroic fortitude;
and the warmest sympathies of his fellow-captives
were with him. Unable to bestir himself, when the walls
of the fort were shaken by the earthquake, he was for a
little time in imminent peril; but a soldier of the 44th,
named Moore, who had acted as the General’s personal
attendant, rushed into the room and carried off the
attenuated old man in his arms. “The poor General,” says
Eyre, who records this incident, “was greatly beloved by
the soldiery, of whom there were few who would not have
acted in a similar manner to save his life.”</p>

<p>The month of March passed quietly over the heads of
the captives. There was little to mark the monotony
of prison-life. Good and bad tidings came in by turns.
All sorts of rumours were in circulation, and all were
volubly discussed. About the middle of the month, the
Nazir, or steward, in charge of the prisoners, announced
that Mahomed Shah Khan was willing to release them all
for two lakhs of rupees. The proposition was made to
Captain Johnson, who convened a meeting of the gentlemen.
The offer was a tempting one, and it might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
been accepted; but Pottinger protested against it. He
was unwilling to aid the enemy with money without the
express sanction of his Government. So the question was
referred to Captain Macgregor; and in the mean while
the perils which beset their position began to thicken
around them. Akbar Khan about this time was wounded
by the accidental discharge of a matchlock in the hands
of one of his attendants; and it was generally believed
throughout the country that Macgregor had bribed the
man to assassinate the Sirdar. Had the wound proved
mortal, there was at least a possibility of all the prisoners
being massacred in revenge.</p>

<p>April came;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and at the end of the first week arrived
the glorious tidings of Sale’s victory over Akbar Khan on
the plain of Jellalabad. Somewhat confusedly was the
story told at first. It was said that the Sirdar had been
killed in the action; and that Mahomed Shah Khan had
also fallen. It was a day of intense excitement&mdash;of painful
speculation and suspense. Some thought that Sale would
push on to their rescue&mdash;others, that the Sirdar, if alive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
would condemn them to death in revenge for his discomfiture;
or that, if he had fallen, they would be massacred
by their guards.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Another day&mdash;and another of doubt
and anxiety followed. The captives watched, with deep
and fearful interest, the deportment of their keepers, who
were seen grouping together and conversing in low mysterious
whispers. “A frightful stillness appeared to prevail.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Then came terrible rumours to the effect that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
captives were to be massacred at sunset. They had been
disarmed; they had neither swords nor pistols&mdash;no means
of resistance were within their reach. They could only
submit to be slaughtered like sheep in the shambles.
But at sunset their fears were dissipated. Mahomed Shah
Khan arrived with a large party of followers. He went
among the prisoners with frank cordiality&mdash;civilly shook
hands with them all&mdash;and then sate down and entered
into conversation with them. It was necessary, he said,
that they should be removed from Budeeabad; and that
they should commence their march on the following
morning. Not a hint fell from him regarding their
future destination, and none were inclined to question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
him. He slept that night in the fort; and the prisoners
began to make preparations for the morrow’s march.
This was no difficult matter. “All my worldly goods,”
wrote Captain Johnson, “might be stowed away in a
towel.”</p>

<p>Morning dawned; and Mahomed Shah Khan busied
himself in the work of plunder.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> There was still some
valuable property clinging to the unhappy captives. They
who had nothing else had good horses. Lady Macnaghten
had jewels and rich shawls. The Ghilzye chief helped
himself freely. Then, utterly ignorant of the direction in
which they were to proceed, the anxious captives started
for their new prison-house. Four camels, with litters,
were assigned to the ladies and such of the gentlemen
as sickness prevented from mounting the ponies which
had been parcelled out amongst them. A guard of
fifty Afghans, horse and foot, escorted the little band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
prisoners on their mysterious march. The European
soldiers were left behind.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded many miles, when two or three
horsemen galloped up, and the party of captives were
suddenly ordered to halt. Tidings had come, it was said,
to the effect that Pollock had been beaten back in the
Khybur Pass, with the loss of his guns, his treasure, and
half his force. Confident of the truth of this atrocious
story, the Afghans of the guard broke out into loud
exultation, and the English officers, reluctant as they were
to believe it, were overborne at last by the confidence of
their escort and compelled to credit the distressing news.
False as was the report, it was not ineffective. The prisoners
were carried back to Budeeabad. With heavy
hearts and sad countenances they returned to their old
prison-house, thinking of the new disasters which had
overtaken their unhappy country. But their hearts were
soon re-animated, and their faces soon brightened up, by
the news which greeted them at Budeeabad. Pollock had
not been beaten back; but had forced the Khybur Pass,
and was marching triumphantly upon Jellalabad. Again,
therefore, the captive party were ordered to resume their
interrupted march; and on the following morning again
they started.</p>

<p>Proceeding for about ten miles, “through a bleak and
barren country,” they came upon a patch of cultivated
ground&mdash;which smiled up in the faces of the prisoners
like an oasis in the desert.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Crossing the river, they
overtook Akbar Khan, sitting in a palanquin, his arm in a
sling, looking pale, haggard, and dejected, as one whose
fortunes were not on the ascendant. They saluted the
Sirdar, passed on, and halted at a short distance from him.
The bivouac was a comfortless one. Strictly guarded and
insufficiently sheltered, they passed the night in dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
discomfort. Rain fell, and under the scanty tents there
was not room for the bedding of the captives. The next
day was one of equal misery&mdash;there was scarcely any food
either for man or beast. On the morning of the 13th a
distressing rumour was current among them. It was said
that the married families were to be carried off in one
direction, and the other captives in another. The scarcity
was so great&mdash;it was so difficult to subsist them all on
one spot&mdash;that it was necessary to divide the party.
This was not to be submitted to without an effort to
obtain the rescision of the obnoxious order. Lawrence
went to the Sirdar, and implored him to suffer them
all to remain together, and to share the same fate. The
Sirdar relented; and they all resumed their march
together.</p>

<p>Their route lay over barren hills and through narrow
stoney valleys. Every now and then little patches of
cultivation sparkled up in the arid waste. There was
little or no food to be obtained. A few almonds and
raisins, or other dried fruits, sufficed to appease the
hunger of the captives, whilst their horses were reduced
to skeletons. The heat was intense. The burning sun
scorched the faces of the European travellers, and peeled
off the white skin. The journey was a long and painful
one, up a steep ascent almost along the whole line of
march. The prisoners knew not whither they were
going; and it seemed that Akbar Khan did not know
where to take them. Some of the captives were suffering
severely. The bad roads and the vicissitudes of the
climate, for heavy rains followed the parching sun, tried
them as in a furnace. General Elphinstone was dying.
Lady Macnaghten and Lady Sale were sick. When
Akbar Khan was made aware of the latter fact, he took
compassion on the English ladies. He was still weak,
and suffering from the effects of his wound; but he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
up the palanquin, or litter in which he had been carried,
for their use; and rode on horseback to the end of the
march.</p>

<p>This was on the 19th of April. On the evening of
that day the prisoners reached Tezeen, and were conducted
to a fort belonging to a petty Ghilzye chief, in
which were all the wives and women of Mahomed Shah
Khan. There they remained, poorly accommodated and
scantily fed, until the 22nd,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> when, with the exception of
General Elphinstone and two or three other invalids, they
were all carried off in the direction of the hills, up a
gradual ascent of many thousands of feet, to a place
called Zanda. There they halted for some weeks, and in
the mean while Captain Mackenzie was despatched in
disguise to Pollock’s camp at Jellalabad; and General
Elphinstone died.</p>

<p>By his fellow-captives his dissolution had long been
anticipated, and was now hardly deplored. Death brought
him a merciful release from an accumulation of mortal
sufferings. Incessant pain of body and anguish of mind
had long been his portion. He felt acutely the humiliating
position into which it had pleased Providence to
cast him, and neither hoped nor wished to live to face his
countrymen in the cantonments of Hindostan, or in the
streets of that great western metropolis which he ought
never to have quitted. They who watched beside the
poor old man, during the painful close of his life, bear
testimony, in touching language, to the Christian fortitude
with which he bore his sufferings, and the Christian
charity with which he spoke of others, under all the
burdens which pressed upon him. The hardships to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which he had been subjected on the march from one
prison-house to another had, perhaps, accelerated the
crisis which was hanging over him; but he had long been
passing away to his rest, and they, who loved him most,
scarcely desired to arrest the progress of the maladies
which were so surely destroying him. He left on record
a statement of all the circumstances of our disasters&mdash;a
statement which I have freely quoted in a preceding part
of my narrative&mdash;but even with this statement in his
hand, he could not have faced his countrymen without
bringing down upon himself a verdict of condemnation.
After all that has been written of his deficiencies at
Caubul, it may seem a startling inconsistency to say that
he was a brave and high-minded gentleman. He was so
esteemed before, in an evil hour for his own and his
country’s reputation, he was ordered to carry his infirmities
across the Indus; and in spite of all the humiliating
circumstances of our discomfiture at Caubul, posterity
may so esteem him. Not upon him, but upon those who
are responsible for his appointment to high military command
at such a time and in such a place&mdash;first, upon
those who sent him to India; secondly, and chiefly, upon
those who sent him to Afghanistan&mdash;must we fix the
shame of this great miscarriage. When he consented to
leave the quiet enjoyment of an honoured old age at
home, to carry his good fame and his broken constitution
to a distant Indian Presidency, he committed a fatal
error, for which he made terrible atonement. But there
are few who will not pity rather than condemn the man,
who found himself suddenly, with all his weakness upon
him, in a sea of difficulty which demanded almost superhuman
strength to buffet through it. In these pages he
has appeared only as the military leader&mdash;as one who, in
the hour of danger, was tried and found wanting. His
fine social qualities cannot be accepted as a set-off to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
military deficiencies. It is not to be pleaded in answer to
the charge of having sacrificed an army at Caubul, that
he was an agreeable gentleman in private life, that he was
always ready with an anecdote and told it well, and that
it was very hard not to love him. But now that it has
been recorded how the soldier became the captive, and
how the captive passed away to his rest, these things may
be set down with a kindly hand upon the last page which
bears his name; and it may be permitted to us, for a little
space, to forget the deficiencies of the soldier whilst we
sympathise with the sufferings of the man.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p class="pch">Stoddart and Conolly&mdash;Intelligence of the Caubul Outbreak&mdash;Arrest of
the English Officers&mdash;Their sufferings in Prison&mdash;Conolly’s Letters
and Journals&mdash;Death of the Prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="beg">There</span> is a painful episode in this epic of the Afghan
war, which perhaps can be introduced in no place more
fitly than in this. Whilst the prisoners, who surrendered
themselves on the march between Caubul and Jellalabad,
were suffering such hardships only as were inseparable
from their position in a rude and inhospitable country,
and the hostages at Caubul were under the protection of
a benevolent and high-minded Afghan nobleman, two
enlightened and chivalrous British officers were enduring
unparalleled sufferings in the dungeons of an Oosbeg
tyrant, far beyond the snowy mountains of the Hindoo-Koosh.
Colonel Stoddart and Captain Conolly were being
devoured by vermin in a cheerless prison in the city of
Bokhara.</p>

<p>It has been shown that in the autumn of 1840, Arthur
Conolly had started from Caubul, ostensibly on a mission
to Khiva and Kokund. He had subsequently, on the
invitation of the Ameer, and with the implied permission,
if not under the direct instructions of the Caubul envoy,
proceeded to Bokhara, where Colonel Stoddart was still
detained, but outwardly in a more honourable and less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
painful state of captivity than that which he had been
condemned to endure during a part of the preceding years.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
It was in the summer of 1841<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> that this invitation was
forwarded to Conolly, then at Kokund; but that state
was then at war with Bokhara, and its rulers hesitated to
allow the departure of her Christian guest. After some
delay, however, Conolly received his passports, and, proceeding
by a circuitous route, reached Bokhara in the
month of November. The crisis was an unfortunate one.
Conolly was from the first regarded with suspicion. The
Ameer believed, or affected to believe, that he had instigated
the states of Kokund and Khiva to war against
him. But other circumstances of a still more inauspicious
character were gathering around the ill-fated
Englishmen.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the month of December, 1841,
that intelligence reached Bokhara to the effect that all
Caubul and the surrounding country had risen against
Shah Soojah and his Feringhee allies, that Sir Alexander
Burnes had been killed, and the British troops beaten in
battle. A few days before, an answer had been received
to a letter addressed by the Ameer to the Queen of
England. The answer was written by the Foreign Secretary,
and it referred the King to the Government of
India. This indignity&mdash;for so he regarded it&mdash;was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
rankling in his mind, when tidings of the Caubul outbreak
reached Bokhara. The Ameer now sent for the English
officers; asked them many questions; said that he would
release Colonel Stoddart, but detain Captain Conolly; and
finally, after pondering the matter for a few days, condemned
them both to imprisonment in the house of the
Topshee-Bashee, or chief artilleryman of Bokhara.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Here their condition became every day more deplorable.
They were not allowed a change of raiment, and the
clothes rotted on their backs. Nauseous vermin preyed
upon their bodies, and they tore the irritated flesh with
their nails. They were not denied either a sufficiency of
food or firing; but water leaked through the roof of the
miserable room in which they were confined. Ague and
fever racked them grievously; but they comforted one
another with Christian consolation, and they prayed
together to the Christians’ God.</p>

<p>In this wretched prison-house, though strictly guarded,
they were not so closely watched that Conolly could not
contrive to spend many an hour chronicling, in small
characters upon Russian paper, all the incidents of captive
life, and drawing up, for the information of his Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
elaborate memoranda on the politics of Central
Asia. In spite of all difficulties of transmission, many
of these notes and memoranda found their way from
Bokhara to Caubul; and, surviving all the chances of
destruction to which the convulsed state of Afghanistan
necessarily exposed them, were conveyed in safety to the
British camp, and are now lying before me.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> In no way
could the sufferings which the Bokhara captives endured
be set forth so truthfully as in extracts from such of
Conolly’s letters and journals as have fortunately been
preserved.</p>

<p>The English officers must have been thrown into prison
about the 17th of December. At the end of that month,
or on the first day of the new year, Allahdad Khan, the
Caubul envoy, was brought in to share their captivity.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
“The Topshee-Bashee, on leaving Allahdad Khan with
us,” wrote Conolly in his journal, “made over to me a
superfluous <i>posteen</i><a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> belonging to my friend, which
enabled me to throw aside the stinking garment given
by the Meer Shub (Master of the Police); this and his
allowing Allahdad Khan to keep the rest of his clothes,
looked as if the Ameer had somewhat relented, as the
Topshee-Bashee would not have dared to show us so much
kindness without leave.” But these hopes were delusive.
The Ameer had not relented. Day after day passed, and
their sufferings increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the month of January little change took
place in the condition of the captives. On the last day
of the month, wrote Conolly, “a Mehrum came to desire
that we would minutely describe the city and castle of
Caubul, and also give an account of Heraut. Allahdad
Khan drew a plan of the first place; Stoddart was named
as the one who best knew the second; but the Mehrum
did not take his account of it. We next day learnt that
he had been sent to the Akhondzadeh,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> who had drawn a
large plan of his native city.” As February wore on,
other encouraging signs of the Ameer’s desire to treat the
prisoners with greater kindness presented themselves. On
the 9th of February another gleam of hope burst in upon
them. The incident is thus touchingly described in
Conolly’s journal:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>February 9 [1842].</i>&mdash;Moolla Nasir came to ask if we had seen the
Peacock throne of India. As every lettered Asiatic should know
that Nadir Shah carried that throne away to Persia, and Moolla
Nasir’s manner was pointedly kind, we judged that the question he
had been sent to ask was a pretence, and that the Ameer desired an
opening for a return to proper treatment of us. Stoddart, therefore,
gave him this, by speaking of his position here as British
agent, and expressing regret that he had not been able to relieve
the Huzrut’s mind from the doubts which he seemed to entertain
of the English Government’s friendship. We showed the sad state
of our clothes (Stoddart had been obliged to put aside his shirt in
consequence of the roof’s having leaked over him the night before),
and expressed hope that the Ameer would soon improve our condition;
but we both spoke cheerfully, that the King might not think
we entertained resentment for his treatment of us.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">All the symptoms of a favourable change in the state
of the Ameer’s feelings proved delusive. Day after day
passed, and the prisoners still remained in the same
unhappy condition; at last, at the end of February,
Conolly wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">We hoped from Moolla Nasir’s visit, and that of the page, who
brought my thermometer, that the Ameer was relenting, but
nothing has since occurred to favour this idea; on the contrary,
the chief would appear to find pleasure in his servant’s accounts
of our discomfort, which may be imagined from the fact that we
have now been seventy-one days and nights without means of
changing or washing our linen, which is hanging in filthy tatters
from our persons. The Topshee-Bashee, who looks in upon us
every seven or eight days, replies to our entreaties for an improvement
in this respect, that our state must be well known to
the Huzrut, whose mind retains thought of the greatest and least
matters, and that nothing can be said to his Majesty about us till
he opens the subject. The Topshee-Bashee, has, I believe, been as
kind to us as he has dared to be. We have had quite enough firing
and food throughout the cold season we have passed in his house,
and continue, thank God! in good health. We sometimes think,
from the Ameer’s keeping back Said’s and the Akhondzadeh’s
packets, that he must have received the Governor-General’s communication,
and that he is acting big in irritation at not having
been answered from the English throne; but it is impossible to
form certain conclusions from his conduct, for it is very often influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
by caprice, which is not very far from madness. We hope
that all is well in Afghanistan, and that, soon as the Hindoo-Koosh
roads become open, the Ameer will receive some communication
which will induce him to properly treat or dismiss us. We beg
that government will convey its sentiments to the Ameer in Persian,
as he will not take our word for what is written in English any
longer than it suits him, and also that no allusion may be made to
the above details, for if the King knew that we were able to send
intelligence he might treat us worse, and perhaps kill everybody
about us. The Russians propose to go about No-roz. We kept
Colonel Boutenoff informed of our proceedings up to the date of
our seizure, and if he should reach Europe ere our release, he may
be able to enlarge this abstract, which is necessarily very imperfect.</p>

<p class="p1">In the second week of March, Conolly’s sufferings
broke out openly in the shape of cold and fever. Enfeebled
and irritated by disease, he then began to despond.
It seemed to him that he was in the toils of
death; and in a high state of excitement, after many
sleepless nights, he wrote to his brother, John Conolly,
then also a prisoner in the hands of a Mussulman enemy,
the following touching letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr p1">From our Prison in the Bokhara Citadel,</p>
<p class="pr6"><i>11th March, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear John</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">This will probably be my last note hence, so I dedicate it
to you, who now, alas! stand next to me. We both dedicate
everything we feel warmest to William, whom may God bless in
all belonging to him, for his long and untiring brotherly affection
to us all! Send my best love to Henry and to all our dear sisters.</p>

<p>This is the eighty-third day that we have been denied the means
of getting a change of linen from the rags and vermin that cover
us; and yesterday, when we begged for an amendment in this
respect, the Topshee-Bashee, who had before come occasionally as
our host to speak encouragingly, set his face like a flint to our
request, showing that he was merely a vane to the withering wind
of his heartless master, and could not help us thus, so that we need
not ask him to do so. This, at first, astonished and defeated us;
we had viewed the Ameer’s conduct as perhaps dictated by mad
caprice; but now, looking back upon the whole, we saw instead that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it had been just the deliberate malice of a demon, questioning and
raising our hopes, and ascertaining our condition, only to see how
our hearts were going on in the process of breaking. I did not
think to shed one warm tear among such cold-blooded men; but
yesterday evening, as I looked upon Stoddart’s half-naked and nail-lacerated
body, conceiving that I was the special object of the king’s
hatred because of my having come to him after visiting Khiva and
Kokund, and told him that the British Government was too great
to stir up secret enmity against any of its enemies, I wept on entreating
one of our keepers, the gunner’s brother, to have conveyed
to the chief my humble request that he would direct his anger
upon me, and not further destroy by it my poor brother Stoddart,
who had suffered so much and so meekly here for three years. My
earnest words were answered by a “Don’t cry and distress yourself;”
he also could do nothing. So we turned and kissed each
other, and prayed together, and then said, in the words of the
Kokunders, “<i>My-bish!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Let him do as he likes! he is a demon,
but God is stronger than the devil himself, and can certainly
release us from the hands of this fiend, whose heart he has perhaps
hardened to work out great ends by it; and we have risen again
from bed with hearts comforted, as if an angel had spoken to them,
resolved, please God, to wear our English honesty and dignity to
the last, within all the filth and misery that this monster may try
to degrade us with.</p>

<p>We hope that, though the Ameer should now dismiss us with
gold clothing, the British and Afghan Governments will treat
him as an enemy; and this out of no feeling of revenge. He
treacherously caused Stoddart to invite me here on his own Imayut-Nameh;
and after Stoddart had given him a translation of a letter
from Lord Palmerston, containing nothing but friendly assurances,
which he could have verified, with our entire consent, at the
Russian embassy, he pent us both up here, because we would not
pay him as a kidnapper for our release, to die by slow rot, if it
should appear that he might venture at last to put us altogether
out of the way. We hope and pray that God may forgive him his
sins in the next world; but we also trust that some human power
will soon put him down from his oppressive throne at this capital,
whence emanates the law by which the Khivans harry and desolate
the roads and homes of the Persians. He wishes every soul to
crouch before him, and not breathe God’s air freely without his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
leave, nor dare to be happy or at ease. For instance (and we are
at the fountain-head of police reports), a poor wretch, confined
without food for three days and nights in the Bug House, an infernal
hole used for severe imprisonment, said incautiously, on
being taken out, that he was alive and well. “He is, is he!” said
the Ameer, on the report; “then put him in for three days and
nights more.” Again, the other night, fifty-six grooms assembled
at a house outside the city, to make merry on pilau and tea, with
money liberally given by one of the Oosbeg men, Rahman Kool
Tohsaba, to his head groom, who acted as master of the feast: they
were convicted of having got together, so all that the police-master
could seize received seventy-five blows each on the back with a
heavy thorn-stick; and because one man uncomplainingly bore his
punishment, which was inflicted on all before the King, he had him
hoisted for seventy-five more, saying, “He must have been struck
softly.” “But what was the crime in this innocent meeting of poor
grooms?” we asked our gaolers. “Who knows?&mdash;he is a king, and
gave the order.” The master of the entertainment stood with his
dagger against some thirty policemen, till he was felled by a stone
thrown at his head, to let all who could escape; for this heavier
offence he was condemned to be thrown from a part of the citadel
wall, which gives a culprit a chance of escape with only the fracture
of a limb, because it has a slope: he threatened to pull down with
him any who should approach the brink to throw him off, and,
leaping boldly down, came to the ground with whole bones, and
lives, let us hope, for many a happy meeting yet with his friends in
this now oppressed city. This is how the Ameer would treat such
ambassadors as he dares insult, who do not bend reverently enough
before him; but the days for such despotism are passing quick, and
he must himself be made to go down before the strong spirit of
Western civilisation. Stoddart has asked me to put on paper my
notions as to the measures that should now be adopted for the
settlement and independent happiness of the Central Asian states;&mdash;here
they are, briefly and freely; those of a man born and bred,
thank God! in Protestant England, who has seen Russia, Persia,
and Afghanistan, and all the three Oosbeg States.</p>

<p>Turn out the horrible Wuzeer Yar Mahomed Khan, who has sold
12,000 men, women, and children, since he obliged the Persians to
retire from Herat, and buy out Kamran’s family from that principality.
Kamran himself forfeited all his kingly right here by his
letter to the Khan Huzrut of Khiva, which the latter chief gave me
in return for my frank communication to him, and which I sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Sir William Macnaghten. Thus will be gained the only point from
which the Afghan nation can lend its weight to the preservation of
peace and the advancement of civilisation in Toorkistan, protect its
weakest subjects from being stolen or sold away, and properly
guard its own and India’s frontier. Next, let Pottinger come in
attendance upon Shah Soojah’s heir-apparent, Shah-zadah Timour,
with a few thousand select Afghan horsemen of both the tribes,
half Douranee and half Ghilzye, to blow down the gate of the
citadel, which unjustly imprisoned us, against the rights of all
nations, except those the Oosbegs profess. The Ameer scornfully
says that the Afghans and English are one people; let him feel that
they really are so in a good cause. I really do believe that if Shah-zadah
Timour were to return, after such a proceeding, to assume
the actual exercise of government at his father’s capital, taking back
with him all real Afghans now enslaved in Toorkistan, whose orthodoxy,
according to the Soonees, is unquestionable, and who might
easily be collected for a friendly offering, the Afghans would so
thoroughly like him and understand us, that every English and
Indian soldier might be withdrawn to Hindostan.</p>

<p>Let the Shah-i-Shah of Persia at the same time write these few
words to the Court of the faithful at Bokhara, sending copies of
his letter by friendly and high ambassadors to Khiva and Kokund:
“I want all my enslaved subjects who are not willing to remain
in Bokhara, and I am now coming, in reliance upon the only God
of justice, to free them, and to destroy the law of <span class="smcap">THY</span> Mooftehed,
by which people who pray towards the same Kebla are sold as
cattle.” Let Mahomed Shah lithograph this, and send a copy to
be stuck up at every mosque where his authority or influence can
reach, in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tartary. This writing will
tell the Ameer that his kingdom has been weighed and found
wanting; it will do much to soften and liberalise Mahomedan
feeling wherever it is read; and if the Persian nation are informed
that it comes to them recommended by English sympathy, they
will dismiss all irritation of mind that was caused by our checking
their military career at Herat.</p>

<p>I feel confident that this great and most necessary measure of
Persian emancipation may be effected at once without shedding
one drop of blood. I never uttered a word of hostility against the
Ameer, either at Khiva or Kokund; but now I am authorised to
show how I thought the rulers of these states, who both hate him,
may be made to end or lessen their own foolish enmity by his
removing from between them. Let the Shah of Persia send a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
firman to Syud Mahomed Zahed, Kurruck Kojeh at Kokund,
whom he knows, saying&mdash;“Tell the Khan Huzrut, of Kokund,
who, I am happy to find, does not deal in my people, that I am
about to liberate all those oppressed men and women who are
unwillingly detained as slaves in Bokhara. I don’t want that
country; and if you will send Lushker Begglerbegge, or Mahomed
Shereff Atalik, with the Kokund army about the same time
to Samarcand, my prime minister shall make it over to him by
treaty, as the capital of Mawarulneh. I shall give up Merve to
the Khan Huzrut of Khiva to be made the capital of Kharasm,
on condition of his doing all he can to restore and content my
unfortunate people, whom his tribes have carried off during my
wars in other directions.”</p>

<p>The best Oosbeg troops are mere rubbish as opponents to Persian
regulars and cannon, and they all know it. Allah Kouli Khan is
the best and most sensible man in his country, and he will remain
quiet while Mahomed Shah comes against Bokhara, if Shakespear
can be empowered to tell him that this is a reform which must be
effected, and which Persia is determined now to effect, with the
commerce of England and Russia. Shakespear can mediate between
the Khan Huzrut and Mahomed Shah for the gentle
emancipation of those who may wish to return home in the next
four or five years, or to settle in the fine waste land of Merve;
and perhaps Mahomed Shah may give to Allah Kouli Khan the
very large colony of [        ],<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> now settled here, who really yet
long for the home of their fathers: this, and securing to him the
Kokund frontier up the Oxus to Balkh, perhaps leaving the khan
of it his easy tributary, would make him agree to all that the
Afghans need for the formation of their frontier from Persian
Khorassan to the Oxus.</p>

<p>England and Russia may then agree about immutable frontiers
for Persia, Afghanistan, Mawarulneh, and Kharasm, in the spirit
which becomes two of the first European nations in the year 1842
of Jesus Christ, the God incarnate of all peace and wisdom. May
this pure and peaceable religion be soon extended all over the
world!</p>

<p>I beg that fifty tillas may be given to Jooma Bai, the servant
who will convey this to Long Joseph. (Let the utmost caution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
be used always in mentioning their names while this Ameer lives
and reigns.) As for Long Joseph, I don’t know what reward to propose
for him. He has risked his life for us in the most gallant
manner, as few men would, except for a brother, and he is a noble
fellow. I feel sure that Government will forgive me for not being
able to make an account of my stewardship during my Toorkish
mission, and that it will use every exertion to set free and to reward
all who have suffered with me, but remained alive.</p>

<p>Allahdad Khan had some 400 tillas in cash when he was brought
back, besides his baggage and horses. Akhondzadeh Saleh Mahomed
has served too well to make it necessary for me to recommend
him. I trust that God has preserved his life. Stoddart
and I will comfort each other in every way till we die, when, may
our brotherhood be renewed in heaven through Jesus Christ our
Saviour! Send this assurance to all our friends, and do you, my
dear John, stand in this faith. It is the only thing that can enable
a man to bear up against the trials of this life, and lead him to the
noblest state of existence in the next. Farewell&mdash;farewell! I

<p class="p1">On the 22nd of March, Conolly again wrote, full of
affectionate solicitude for the sufferings of his friends,
but little mindful of his own:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">After sending a page with my thermometer on the 15th ult.
(February), to ask how much cold it indicated, as detailed in my
last letter, the Ameer took no notice of us till the 13th of this
month, when he sent the gold chronometer which I had given
him, to show that its chain was broken, and to ask if we could
repair it; a pretence, the Topshee-Bashee said, to ascertain what
state we were in. We had both become ill a few days before,
from a sudden cold change of weather and the discomfort of
filthy clothing; and I, who had given in most to the sickness,
owing to anxiety of mind regarding the many persons whom I had
been the means of bringing into the Ameer’s tyrannous hands,
was lying weak in bed with fever when the last page came.
The Topshee-Bashee, who for some time spoke encouragingly
about changing our clothes, had by this time caused us plainly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
understand that he neither dared himself to amend our position
in this respect, nor even to represent it to the Ameer. He now
tried to save us by telling the page that I had been confined to
my bed eight days, and by remarking upon the wretched state of
our apparel after eighty-five days’ and nights’ wear. I showed the
Mehrum that Stoddart had been obliged to cast away all his
under-clothing, and was suffering much from cold on the chest.
I experienced hope that the Ameer would take some pity upon us,
and especially upon such of my late travelling companions and
people as might be suffering under his displeasure. The page said
that he would make a representation if the Huzrut questioned him;
and he afterwards told the Topshee-Bashee that, on the Ameer’s
doing so, he had stated that the King’s last-come slave, Khan-Ali
(Conolly), had been very ill for eight or nine days; to which the
Huzrut had replied, “May he not die (or, I suppose, he won’t die)
for the three or four days that remain till his going.” We thought
from this that the Ameer proposed to send us away with the
Russians, who were said to be preparing to depart after the <i>No-roz</i>.
Nothing else has since transpired regarding ourselves; but through
the indefatigable Long Joseph we have learnt the following items of
intelligence about our friends.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th inst., Ibraheem wrote: “With regard to Caubul be
quite at ease; 30,000 people (rebels?) have been slaughtered there.”
Allahdad Khan, the Akhonzadeh, Eusoff Khan (Augustin), the
Jemadar, Meer Akhor, with Bolund Khan, Kurreem Khan, and Gool
Mahomed, had been released; for which we sincerely thanked
God. Their sufferings, poor fellows, in that horrible dungeon, must
have been great....</p>

<p>On the 23rd, we were made further happy by the verbal intelligence
of Long Joseph that Allahdad Khan and the rest of our
people had been released.</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the 24th, he again recorded that a ray of hope
had broken into his dreary dungeon:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>24th.</i>&mdash;This forenoon, the Topshee-Bashee coming to see us,
said, with a cheerful manner, “‘Sewonchee’&mdash;Reward me for glad
tidings. I represented your great want of clothes, and proposed to
buy shirts and trousers for you from the bazaar: but the Huzrut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
said, ‘They don’t wear bazaar clothes; in three or four days I’ll
give them dresses of honour and dismiss them.’ And the Huzrut
asked Meerza Juneid which road would be the best one for you to
travel by, saying, ‘They cannot now go in that direction’ (apparently
meaning Caubul). Meerza Juneid replied, that the route by Persia
would now be the best. After which the Ameer spoke graciously
about you. He said that Khan-Ali was a well-informed person,
that the Meerza represented that he had conversed very little
with Khan-Ali, but that Stoddart of whom he had seen much,
was a man instructed upon all matters.” We doubted the Topshee-Bashee’s
having dared to make a representation of himself regarding
us. And the old guardian mentioned afterwards that Meerza
Juneid had come to his brother’s office. Probably desiring to
know whether I was better or worse in health since the 13th, the
Ameer sent Meerza Juneid, in his capacity of physician, to make
inquiries in this matter.</p>

<p class="p1">A few days afterwards, remembering how he had
written, under the excitement, almost the delirium of
fever, a desponding letter to John Conolly, he wrote
more cheerfully to his brother, begging him, if the
letter reached its destination, not to be dispirited by
it, for that both he and Stoddart were now in good
health:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1">Bokhara Citadel, <i>28th March, 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">My dear John</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">We have been comforted by intelligence that the Ameer
has released Allahdad Khan and all my people from the gaol
in which he so unjustly and cruelly confined them....
The Ameer has lately been talking, we hear, of sending us away,
and though we do not set much store by his words, we think it
possible he may give us to the Russian Mission, who are about to
depart.... I wrote you a longish letter on the 11th of
this month, when I was in a high state of excitement, from fever
and several nights of sleepless anxiety. The burden of it was an
entreaty to the last effect regarding my poor people, and a hope
that the British Government would seize the opportunity which
the Ameer’s faithlessness had given them to come forward with
Persia to put him down, and give his country to Kharasm and
Kokund, on condition of the entire suppression of the Persian and
Afghan slave trade in Toorkistan. If that paper (which I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
endeavour to recover) should reach you, compress its words into
this purport and destroy it, reserving my last good wishes for the
friends to whom I addressed them, thinking that I might not live
much longer. I am now, thank God, almost well in health again, and
the news regarding our people has set my mind at rest. Stoddart,
also, who was suffering awhile from severe cold, is, I rejoice
to say, convalescent. We are both in a very uncomfortable state,
as you may imagine, having been ninety-nine days and nights
without a change of clothes; but we are together. Stoddart is
such a friend as a man would desire to have in adversity, and our
searchers having missed the little Prayer-book which George
Macgregor gave us (tell him), we are able to read and pray, as well
as to converse together. God bless you, my dear John. Send my
love to everybody, and believe me,</p>

<p class="p1">The passages omitted from this letter relate almost
entirely to the services and the pay of Conolly’s attendants.
There is nothing more remarkable in his
letters and journals, written at this time, than his tender
regard for others, and his forgetfulness of self. Not
only did he grieve for the sufferings of his friend, and
endeavour, by putting him forward as the real representative
of the British Government, to obtain Stoddart’s
release, or at least a mitigation of the severity of his
confinement, but he exhibited, also, the tenderest solicitude
for the welfare of all the servants who had accompanied
him to Bokhara, and, in the midst of his own
affliction, even on the bed of sickness and in the near
prospect of death, thought of nothing more earnestly than
the future welfare of his poor dependents.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> On the 5th
of April he wrote in his journal:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>April 5.</i>&mdash;When I came here, Stoddart did his utmost to put
me forward; but now, as long as the Ameer detains him, I shall
refer to him as the accredited British agent, every communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on business that the Ameer may make to me, whether we should be
together or separated. He well knows all the people here, and the
dignity of our government is safe in his hands.</p>

<p>We have heard that the Russians are about to depart, and that
they are to take their enslaved people with them; but we cannot
get at the truth of the statement. Report also says that the
Ameer will march with his army seven or eight days hence.
There is no doubt that he is preparing for an early move; but
though Takkind and Kokund are named as his points of attack,
it is not certain that he will go eastward. This is the 107th day
of our confinement, without change of clothes; but the weather
having become warmer, we can do without the garments that
most harboured the vermin that we found so distressing, and we
are both now, thank God! quite well. We trust that our friends
will be informed of our well-being. We have desired all our
servants, except Ibraheem (who remains behind to keep up correspondence),
to return to their homes as soon as their strength
enables them to travel, begging them to make their way anyhow,
and to rest assured that everything due will be made up to them
on their reaching Caubul.... Allahdad Khan behaved very
firmly in refusing to allow that he was the servant of a Feringhee
servant, as the Ameer wished him to do, and did justice both to
the dignity of his royal master and to the policy of the British
Government in Afghanistan. I beg that his conduct may be
mentioned to Shah Soojah, and I trust that all his losses will be
made up to him; but if the preparation of the account is left to
him, he will make it a very large one, and part of the settlement
may perhaps be deferred till it is decided whether or not the Ameer
is to be called upon for repayment.</p>

<p>When our last packet was despatched we deemed it not impossible,
from the Ameer’s expressions, which had been reported to us,
that his Majesty designed to send us away with the Russian Mission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Our keepers rather inclined to the idea that Huzrut would dismiss
us about the same time by the route of Persia; and the Topshee-Bashee’s
old brother talked seriously about performing a pilgrimage
to the holy city of Meshid in our company.</p></div>

<p class="p1">These hopes were most delusive. As time advanced,
the prospects of restoration to liberty became more and
more remote. About the middle of the month of April,
the Russian Mission took its departure; and the Ameer
set out from Bokhara at the head of a grand military
expedition against the state of Kokund. On the 13th
of April, Conolly wrote in his journal:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>April 13.</i>&mdash;We heard that the Russians had been dismissed
with presents of honour, that the Kodiyar Beg Karawool
Beggee, ranking as captain or commander of 100, had been
attached to Colonel Boutenoff as the Ameer’s envoy to St.
Petersburg, and that the Huzrut had promised to promote him
to the grade of Tok-Suba, commander of 1000, privileged to
bear a cow-tail banner, on his return after the performance of
good service. The Ameer’s own arrangements were said to be
completed, and the direction of it certainly to the eastward. An
envoy from Kokund, who arrived two days ago, was not received,
but was told to go about his own business wherever he
listed. Our informant mentioned at the same time that the last
envoy from Khiva had been dismissed a fortnight before with extraordinary
honour, all his servants getting dresses. We now
also learned that the heir of the Koondooz chief had sent an
envoy to the Ameer, who had ordered one of his officers, a Khojeh,
styled Salam Aghassi, to accompany that agent to Koondooz on
his return. It was thought, we were told, that the Khojeh of
Balkh would endeavour to take Koondooz on Meer Morad’s death,
and the heir may, in this apprehension, have been alert to put himself
under the Ameer’s protection. This morning the Ameer
showed the Topshee-Bashee an especial mark of favour by
sending him a loaf of refined sugar from the palace; towards
evening his Majesty rode four miles to a place of pilgrimage, and
on his return at night had the Topshee-Bashee up to give him some
orders.</p>

<p class="p1">The narrative then proceeds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Early next morning (the 14th) the Ameer marched out to the
sound of his palace kettle-drums and trumpets, leaving us in the
filthy clothes which we had worn for 115 days and nights. We
said to the Gunner’s old brother, when he mentioned the Ameer’s
having departed, “Then the Meshid caravan apparently stands
fast.” “No,” was his reply; “please God it will go soon. I asked
the Topshee-Bashee last night if nothing had been settled about
you, and he replied, ‘When the Russians get out a march or so,
the Dustan Kanchee will make a petition about them, and they
will be dismissed.’” The old man also remarked, probably from
what he had heard his brother say, that the Ameer had expressed
himself to the effect that he knew the Russian Elchee was led to
get us in order to make a boast of having procured our release,
which made it seem as though Colonel Boutenoff had been endeavouring
to obtain our dismissal. Our old keeper persisted for some
days in assuring us of his belief that our immediate dismissal was
designed, and on the 18th said that he was going down into
the city to seek out my Dewan Beggee, Eusoff Khan (Augustin), to
set his mind at ease about us; he returned, saying that he had
been referred from place to place without finding Eusoff Khan, or
any of our people; but that one Meer Hyder and another shopkeeper
of his acquaintance had assured him that they were all in
the town, and that four or five of them were in the habit of coming
occasionally at night to a certain quarter, to hear books read. We
had thought the gunners might have received orders to collect some
of our people in order to our respectable dismissal; but knowing
that all our men, except Ibraheem, had left Bokhara, we concluded
that the Topshee-Bashee had made use of his old brother to deceive
us, in order to keep us hopeful and quiet for another period, as he
said nothing about changing our clothes, and kept himself quite
aloof from us, which he would hardly have done had he believed
what he reported in the Ameer’s name.</p>

<p>Just before the Ameer’s departure, we heard that a British
Elchee had arrived at Merve, on his way hither. We could get no
further accounts of the said Elchee, but judged that it might be
Shakespear on his way to Khiva.... [<i>MS.</i> defaced]
... From the 4th to the 7th of May the palace drums
and trumpets were continually sounding for intelligence that
Kokund had been taken after a faint endeavour at resistance
under the famed Kokund general, Guda Bai; that the latter had
been taken prisoner, and that the rebellious town had been given
up to plunder, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Then follows much of Bokhara politics, the manuscript
being greatly defaced&mdash;and after this, some passages of
personal narrative, the chronicle of which extends up to
the 24th of May&mdash;the latest date under which I have
been able to discover anything in the hand-writing of
Arthur Conolly:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">We had expressed to our old guardian a wish to get some money
from Meshid, with which to reward him for his kindness, (and to
get) him privately to buy (us) a few necessaries in the event of our
further detention, and, liking the idea, he, on the 19th instant
(May), brought secretly to see us his son-in-law Budub, employed
as a caravan-bashee between Bokhara and the Holy City, who
agreed to act as agent in the business after another week.
Inquiring the news from Budub, we heard that Kamran was
said to be confined in Herat by Yar Mahomed Khan&mdash;that the
English remained as before at Candahar and Caubul&mdash;and
that four Elchees, English, Russian, Persian, and Turkish, had
gone together to Khiva, each displaying his national flag, and
told the Khan Huzrut that he had the choice of quietly giving
up plundering and slave-dealing, or of meeting the Shah of
Persia, who had assembled a large army for the redress of his
people.</p>

</table>

<p>Our old friend now informed us, on the authority of his Afghan
acquaintance, Meer Hyder, that all our people had left Bokhara
on hearing that they had been inquired about.... Possibly
the Ameer really did mean to send us away at the time of his
marching, but deferred to do so on hearing that we had no servants
left here, or from one of his incalculable caprices. I had noted, in
a detailed report of our proceedings after leaving Kokund, which
when we were seized I was waiting the Ameer’s permission to
despatch by a courier to Caubul, an expression which the Naib
heard his Majesty had uttered in his camp after my arrival, to the
effect that he would give the English a few rubs more, and then
be friends with them again. Though we were not sure that the
Amer had so spoken, the plan seems one likely to be entertained
by an ignorant and weak man, anxious to give an imposing
impression of his greatness and confidence; and to it I partly
attributed the ungraciousness of my public reception in camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
though I was the Naib’s honoured guest; the failure of the
Huzrut to recover the horses and the property of my servants
which had been plundered at his outposts, when bringing letters
to him, and the hauteur with which, at the first joint reception of
Stoddart and myself here, he caused it to be signified to us that
as in old times there had been friendship between the Mussulmans
and infidels, there existed no objection to the establishment of
friendly relations between the states of Bokhara and England;
but that the Huzrut desired to know whether we (the English)
had been travellers over all Toorkistan to spy the land with a
view to take it, as we had taken Caubul, or for other purposes;
and wished all our designs to be unveiled, in order that if they
were friendly they might become apparent, and that if hostile, they
might still be known. The Government of India, knowing what
communications it has sent to Bokhara, will be able to judge the
Ameer’s conduct better than we are.</p>

<p>On the 19th (May) the Topshee-Bashee paid us a visit of a few
moments, after keeping away for two months. He mentioned that
a man with a name like Noor Mohumnud had come three or four
days before from Persia, bringing a load of things for Stoddart, of
which the Dustan Kanchee had forwarded a list to the Ameer&mdash;probably
the articles which should have accompanied Lord Palmerston’s
letter. The Huzrut, the Topshee-Bashee said, would doubtless,
on his return, be gracious to us, and give us fine robes of
honour, and treat us even better than before.</p>

<p>About sunset on the 23rd, as Stoddart and myself were pacing
up and down a small court of twenty feet long, which encloses
our prison, one of the citadel doorkeepers came and desired us
both to sit down in a corner; we complied, wondering what would
follow, and presently saw heads peering at us from the adjoining
roofs, when we understood that the Ameer’s heir, a youth of seventeen,
had taken this way of getting a sight of the Feringhee Elchees.
We must have given him but a poor impression in the remains of
our clothes, and with heads and beards uncombed for more than
five months.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, Jooma Bai was accosted by a man named Makhzoom,
known to Stoddart, who gave him a token, and a note
written in such bad grammar as scarcely to be understood, in which
he said one Juleb arrived lately from Khiva, mentioned that he saw
Pottinger Sahib there, and another person named Moosa having
come, bringing a letter from Pottinger Sahib, who, he says, is at
Khiva, with the Elchee of Mahomed Shah.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Authentic history here terminates. Beyond this all is
doubt and conjecture. On the 28th of May, Stoddart
despatched an official letter to the Indian Government,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
which was forwarded with Conolly’s journals; and at
this point we lose altogether the track of the footprints
which the Bokhara captives have left on the great desert
of time. That they perished miserably is certain. “No
change has taken place in our treatment,” wrote Stoddart&mdash;it
is the last sentence penned in the Bokhara prison
which seems to have reached its destination&mdash;“though
hopes, so long proved to be deceitful, are held out to us
on the return of the chief.” But the Ameer, glutted with
conquest, returned from the Kokund expedition, and
ordered them out to death. They died by the hands of
the public executioner. But the precise period of their
death is not with certainty to be ascertained.</p>

<p>There is but scanty evidence to enable us to determine
the point. That which is most credible is the evidence of
Saleh Mahomed, a youth whom Major Todd despatched
from Herat, to join Captain Conolly’s suit. His story is,
that in the month of June, 1842, Stoddart and Conolly
were executed by order of the Ameer; that he derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
his information from one of the executioners; and that he
saw their graves. On the 17th of June, it is related, they
were taken out of their prison, and, in the presence of an
assembled multitude, led into a small square. Their
hands were bound together before them. Their graves
were dug before their eyes. Stoddart was first marked
for death. He cried aloud against the tyranny of the
Ameer; and his head was cut off with a knife. Conolly
was then offered his life, on condition that he would
adopt the Mussulman faith. But he indignantly rejected
the proposal. “Stoddart,” he said, “became a Mussulman,
and yet you kill him: I am prepared to die.” And
then Arthur Conolly, full of faith in the merits of his
Redeemer, stretched forth his neck, and died.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing more painful than this in all the
history of the Central-Asian war. It would be unjust to
encourage a belief in the reader’s mind that efforts were
not made to compass the liberation of Colonel Stoddart.
From the time when Major Pottinger first received at
Herat intimation of his friend’s captivity, and wrote to
the Ameer a protest against the outrage he had committed,
to a date long subsequent to the deaths of
Stoddart and Conolly, continual efforts were made, both
from the side of India and of England, to accomplish this
great object. Todd did all that he could do from Herat;
Abbott and Shakespear did all that they could do from
Khiva; Macnaghten did all that he could do from
Caubul; Lord Auckland did all that he could do from Calcutta.
From London, Lord Palmerston directed our
ambassadors at St. Petersburgh and Constantinople to
obtain the agency of the Courts at which they were resident;
and both the Sultan and Count Nesselrode wrote
urgent letters to Bokhara in behalf of the British
prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> But when all this is related, it still appears
that more regard might have been shown for Stoddart’s
position, and that if there had been greater promptitude
in answering the references made by him to the home
authorities, he might have taken advantage of a favorable
change in the feelings of the Ameer, and of his own circumstances,
to take his departure from Bokhara. Certain
it is that Stoddart felt acutely the culpable indifference
to his fate displayed by the British Government. As far
back as the July of the preceding year he had written:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">News from me you will not expect, nor have I the least word of
interest to offer you, except that I am waiting the replies of government,
before I am finally released and take my departure. Nothing
can be more slack than the time and means taken to provide
me with those replies, and my disgust perfectly negatives any
attempt to write a commonly agreeable note. My last news from
Caubul, dated June 6, says that poor Todd is there awaiting, if
possible, a mitigation of his sentence. Conolly is not yet here from
Kokan, nor have my messengers to him yet returned. They conveyed
the orders from Caubul, and an invitation to the Ameer, to
return by this route.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p class="p1">On the 28th of February, 1842, he wrote again, as a
kind of endorsement to one of Conolly’s letters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

Captain Conolly</i>] has been sacrificed.</p>

<p class="pr4">Your obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p class="p1">The words within brackets were erased&mdash;most probably
by Conolly.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>But Stoddart, though he may have resented the injustice
of sacrificing him to no purpose, was ready to
become a sacrifice if, by so doing, he could promote the
interests of his country. “I beg sincerely,” he wrote on
the 5th of April, “that no one will regret any sacrifice
of me, for it is nothing at all. It may yet not be requisite&mdash;but
if it be, I regard the probable result, from the
action of government in doing justice to others, and
bringing all these countries to reasonable conduct, as
fully compensating a much greater sacrifice than that of
so humble an individual as I am.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> If anything could
increase the sorrow with which we contemplate the fate
of this brave man, it would be a perusal of such noble
sentences as these.</p>

<p>It was under a high and chivalrous sense of duty to
his government that Colonel Stoddart continued to face
the dangers of his position at Bokhara, after he might
have escaped from them; and it was under an equally
strong sense of duty that Captain Conolly made his way
to the inhospitable city. To describe them officially as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
“innocent travellers,” was clearly a misapplication of
language; and yet, when on the famous 1st of October,
1842, Lord Ellenborough addressed the following letter to
the Ameer of Bokhara, he so described them both:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1">Simlah, <i>October 1st, 1842.</i></p>

<p class="pn">A. C.</p>

<p class="phb">The Queen of England, my royal mistress, has sanctioned my
coming to India, to conduct its government, and direct its armies.</p>

<p>On my arrival, I found that great disasters had befallen those
armies, and much injury had been inflicted on my countrymen and
the people of India by the treacherous Afghans, under Mahomed
Akbar Khan.</p>

<p>In forty days from the time when I directed to British armies,
reinforced from India, to move forward, three great victories have
been gained over the Afghans; the city and citadel of Ghuznee have
been destroyed, and now the Balla Hissar of Caubul is in my power.</p>

<p>Thus, by God’s aid, have I afflicted with merited punishment the
murderers of their own king and of a British minister. In this I
have avenged the cause of all sovereigns and of all nations.</p>

<p>The wife and family of Mahomed Akbar Khan are prisoners, and
my soldiers are now conducting them to the sea.</p>

<p>Thus are the wicked punished, even in their wives and families.</p>

<p>I hear that you, too, have gained great successes, at which I
rejoice, if you had just ground of complaint against your enemy.</p>

<p>It is in the midst of successes that clemency most becomes the
conqueror, and gives to him an extent of permanent fame which
often does not attend on victory.</p>

<p>I was informed, when I reached India, that you detained in
confinement two Englishmen, supposing them to have entertained
designs against you. This must have been your reason, for no
prince detains an innocent traveller.</p>

<p>I am informed that they are innocent travellers. As individuals
they could not entertain designs against you; and I know they
were not employed by their government in such designs, for their
government is friendly to you.</p>

<p>Send them away towards Persia. It will redound to your
honour. They shall never return to give you offence, but be sent
back to their own country.</p>

<p>Do this as you wish to have my friendship.</p>

<p class="p1">So manifest a repudiation of the official character of
these two officers was not right; and it has been said, by
one whose zeal and enthusiasm overlaid his judgment
and discretion, but who is still entitled to honourable
mention for his generous exertions in a hopeless cause,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
that this very letter, in all likelihood, caused the execution
of the prisoners. To describe them as travellers was,
it is said, to proclaim them as spies. But the letter,
however dangerous in itself, was at least harmless in its
results. Before it was even written, the “innocent travellers”
had journeyed to a land where the tyranny of
princes could not reach them&mdash;where the wicked cease
from troubling and the weary are at rest.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[April-July: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">Affairs at Caubul&mdash;Elevation of Futteh Jung&mdash;Opposition of the
Barukzyes&mdash;Arrival of Akbar Khan&mdash;His Policy&mdash;Attack on the
Balla Hissar&mdash;Its Capture&mdash;Conduct of Akbar Khan&mdash;Barukzye
Strife&mdash;Defeat of Zemaun Khan&mdash;Situation of the Hostages and
Prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="beg">On</span> the death of Shah Soojah there commenced in
Caubul a civil war. The whole city was thrown into
convulsion. Futteh Jung, the second son of the murdered
Shah, was proclaimed King. He was a man of
weak understanding and infamous character; but he was
believed to be friendly to the British Government, and he
both hated and feared the Barukzyes. In himself a mere
cypher, he could have done nothing to resist the encroachments
of that powerful tribe; but Ameen-oollah
Khan threw all the weight of his influence into the scales
in favour of the Prince, and for some time they seemed
equally balanced. The Naib cared nothing for the Prince;
but he scented the royal treasures, and where the money
lay the thickest, there was sure to be Ameen-oollah
Khan.</p>

<p>In such troublous times as he had now fallen upon,
the Prince had little taste for royalty. He remembered
the fate of his father; and shrunk from the perilous
excitement in which he was now about to be plunged.
Weak, too, as he was, he had sagacity enough to perceive
that British power was again on the ascendant, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
whatever might be the result of the internecine strife
which was now convulsing the capital, the supremacy of
the British would be speedily re-established. It was
expedient, therefore, he thought, to exert himself to the
utmost, to obtain the favourable consideration of his old
Feringhee allies; so he despatched earnest letters to
Captain Macgregor at Jellalabad, pleading both for himself
and the memory of his murdered father, protesting his
inviolate attachment and loyalty to the English Government,
and imploring them to tell him what to do.</p>

<p>Futteh Jung had been proclaimed King by Ameen-oollah
Khan and the Populzyes; but the Barukzyes refused
to recognise him. Again they set up the Newab
Zemaun Khan, and openly defied the Suddozye power.
Soon the two contending parties broke out into open
hostilities. Ameen-oollah Khan and his puppet were the
first to draw the sword. On the 1st of May there was
fighting from house to house&mdash;the whole city was in commotion.
On the following day, success began to declare
itself on the side of the Barukzyes. Ameen-oollah Khan
made a false move, and disastrously over-reached himself.
Believing that the act would dishearten the Barukzyes,
he seized the person of Meer Hadjee, the chief Moollah.
But very different was the real from the anticipated effect
of this outrage. Nearly all the townspeople, before
neutral, rose to avenge this insult offered to their High
Priest. The Kohistanees joined them. The Hadjee was
released. But popular indignation ran high against
Ameen-oollah Khan. His house was burnt. His property
was plundered. His servants were seized. Compelled
to seek safety in flight, he flung himself into the Balla
Hissar.</p>

<p>The Prince made a show of welcoming him, but secretly
declared that he would willingly surrender him and his
Populzye associates to the British, if Pollock would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
advance upon Caubul&mdash;that one of his main objects,
indeed, in opening the gates to them was to have the
rebels more securely in his power.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The Naib knew that
his position was a dangerous one, and declared that he
would throw himself on the mercy of the British and take
his chance of being hanged. There was a more unrelenting
enemy beyond the walls of the Balla Hissar.
The Barukzyes were eager to destroy him.</p>

<p>The contest now raged furiously. The guns of the
Balla Hissar were opened upon the city. Multitudes of
the townspeople fled in dismay. There were 5000 men
in the citadel; there was no lack of provisions. The
money was all in the hands of the Prince; and he disbursed
it freely to his adherents. But the Barukzyes
were miserably poor. They could only raise money by
the sale of jewels and the exaction of fines; and the
Kohistanees and others who flocked to their standard
envied the fortunate followers of the more opulent
Prince.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>It was not likely that Akbar Khan would regard with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
unconcern these proceedings at the capital. He was
awaiting the return of Captain Mackenzie from Jellalabad,
when intelligence of the disturbed state of affairs at
Caubul was brought to him. Determining first, however,
to learn the result of the mission to General Pollock’s
camp, he resolved to set out for the scene of strife, and
to take one or two of the English officers with him.
Mackenzie returned on the 3rd of May, and was immediately
despatched by the Sirdar on a second mission
to Jellalabad, whilst Akbar Khan, taking Pottinger and
Troup with him, set out on the following day for the
capital.</p>

<p>Arrived at Caubul, the Sirdar played his game with some
address. Sedulously giving currency to the intelligence
that he had been in treaty with General Pollock, who was
said to have recognised his authority, he enhanced his
own importance in the eyes of his countrymen, and sowed
disaffection among the adherents of the royal party.
Many who had before been neutral, now, believing that
the British were on amicable terms with the Sirdar,
openly espoused his cause. Khan Shereen Khan and the
Kuzzilbashes had hitherto remained inactive; but feeling
the importance of their coadjutancy, Akbar Khan made
strenuous efforts to obtain it, and gained at last a promise
of support.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> From day to day there was continual strife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and much fighting. The advantage was for the most part
on the side of the Barukzyes. The Prince had thrown up
some outworks round the Balla Hissar; but partly owing
to the weakness and partly to the treachery of the guards,
they had been carried by the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Pottinger witnessed
some of these engagements, and wrote of them as
most contemptible affairs.</p>

<p>It soon became only too probable that the Balla Hissar
itself would fall before the Barukzyes. The energy and
vigour of Akbar Khan and his confederates greatly exceeded
that of the wretched Prince and his few interested
supporters. Fearful of this, Futteh Jung continued to
write pressing letters to the British authorities at Jellalabad,
urging them to push on to his relief, and Mohun
Lal gave cogency to the request by setting forth the
probability of the Balla Hissar falling into the hands of
the Barukzyes, and the strength which that party would
derive, not only from the occupation of such a commanding
position, but from the possession of the royal treasures.
Like his father, however, the Prince continued to declare
that his money was failing, and to request the British to
supply him with funds to carry on the war. But more
than all he clamoured for the advance of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
army. On the 11th of May he wrote to Captain Macgregor:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The reason of the present contest is this. I wished to excite a
dispute between the Barukzyes and the other wicked men, with a
view that they should have no leisure even to touch their own
heads, and thus the English army may reach here unmolested. To
effect this cause, whatever gold and silver I had has been paid to
the people, with the object of securing the interests of the British.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
Now I have very little cash remaining in the treasury&mdash;enough
only to support me for some ten or fifteen days more. After that
period, without assistance from the British, I shall be reduced to
the greatest difficulty. The men of the world are the disciples
and worshippers of money. If you will not raise the victorious
standard of the British troops quickly, or do not send me reinforcements
within a few days, all the people will desert me on account of
not having money, and the Barukzyes will then have the upper-hand
over me.</p>

<p>If the Barukzyes establish their power, serious evil is to be
apprehended; and the household of the British ally (Shah Soojah)
will be destroyed. After this there will be nothing in store for us
but repentance and disgrace. It is as clear to all the people as the
sun, that I am soliciting the assistance of the friends and nations of
my late father. In delaying this object many dangers may arise,
and much harm may befall the needy. In such a crisis as this, all
objects may be easily gained; and the affairs which are now reduced
to a state of disorder will, without much difficulty, be brought into
order again.</p>

<p>If you are delaying your march on account of supplies of grain,
you need not care for this. If it pleases God that I should
recover my authority, there will be thousands of “Khurwars”
(measures of ten maunds) of grain, as well as plenty of fodder for
the horses.</p>

<p>I have heard that the Bombay forces have reached Candahar, and
also marched thence to this quarter. It would be highly desirable,
if the victorious army of Calcutta should possess this country
before the arrival of the Bombay forces, that it should show the
world that your arms alone have gained the victory. Although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
army of both sides belongs to the same government, I write thus
because I wish you well.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">On the day after this letter was written, three holy
men presented themselves before the Prince, with overtures
of peace from the Sirdar. They set forth that
whatever oaths Futteh Jung might desire the Barukzye
chief to swear to him, would be solemnly sworn on the
Koran. “Of what avail are oaths,” asked the Prince;
and sending for several Korans from another apartment,
showed the <i>Syuds</i> how they were covered with the seals
of the Barukzye, the Douranee, the Caubulee, the Persian,
and the Kohistanee chiefs. “This,” added the Prince,
“is God’s holy book, in which all the faithful believe.
Look at these seals and the oaths of fidelity written upon
the margin, declaring that the enemies of the royal family
are the enemies of Mahomed&mdash;and yet the Barukzyes
have murdered the King, my father. If there be any
other Koran sent from Heaven, let the Barukzyes swear
solemnly upon it&mdash;this has been tried too often, and too
often found wanting.” The Syuds were then dismissed.
Nothing was done towards a satisfactory arrangement.
So Mahomed Shah Khan was sent to conduct the negotiations
with the Suddozye Prince.</p>

<p>What were the proposals made to the Prince, and in
what light he regarded them, may be gathered from
the letter which, on the following day, he addressed to
Captain Macgregor:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The circumstances of this quarter are as follows. Since the
arrival of Mahomed Akbar Khan, the Barukzyes at the head of the
Ghilzyes, Caubulees, and the Kohistanees, attacked the trenches I
had built out at a distance. Some of them were taken by the
enemy on account of the weakness of my guards, and others in
consequence of the treachery of my people. All the trenches round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the Balla Hissar have fallen into the hands of the enemy, and we
are now in a perfect siege. Yesterday, Mahomed Shah Khan,
Ghilzye, came to treat with Ameen-oollah Khan into the Balla
Hissar, and the result of their negotiation, after solemn oaths, was
as follows:&mdash;That I should be acknowledged as King&mdash;Mahomed
Akbar Khan as Minister of State&mdash;and that Ameen-oollah Khan
should hold the situation of Deputy (“Naib”) under the minister.
After this, Mahomed Shah Khan was brought to my presence, and
I was obliged to give him a “Khelat;” but agreeably to the advice
of my well-wishers, I deferred giving my acquiescence to the result
of their negotiation for two or three days to come.</p>

<p>They have made four proposals to me,&mdash;Firstly, that I should
allow Mahomed Akbar Khan to be my minister, and Ameen-oollah
Khan his deputy. They are then both to raise an army and to go
and fight with the English forces coming up to Caubul. Secondly,
they will stand neutral, if I like; but I must prepare to go and
oppose the British troops. Thirdly, if I am powerful, I must get
ready to wage war with the Barukzyes. Fourthly, that I should
take the whole family of the late King, and go wherever I like to
go with them.</p>

<p>It appears that Ameen-oollah Khan, on account of our weakness,
has consented to their proposals, and has therefore gone out of the
Balla Hissar to have a conference with Mahomed Akbar Khan.
These proposals have perplexed me greatly, and I am lost in speculation.
If I were to appoint Mahomed Akbar Khan my minister, he
would raise a force to oppose the English, and I should be forced to
give up my artillery to him, which will be a dangerous business.
In case of my refusal, the family of the late martyr (King) will be
outraged.</p>

<p>My anxiety for your departure from Jellalabad for Caubul appears
thoroughly useless. It is now forty days since your victorious
army has passed up through Khybur, and you have not yet left
Jellalabad. I endeavoured to excite a dispute among the rebels,
with the view that the English army should reach here without
opposition. Although I have successively sent letters through
Mohun Lai, asking you to advance immediately to this side, but no
symptoms of the kind have yet appeared. In such delay dangerous
evils are to be apprehended.</p>

<p>It is a long time that I have deputed and entrusted Meerza
Ameen-oollah with my verbal messages to you; but no answer has
yet reached me about it. You should quickly reply to my letters,
as well as the messages I have sent you by him, and also let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
know the day of your march, as I am now in much perplexity. If
there be any hope of your immediate advance, I will undergo every
hardship to defend the Balla Hissar, and engage the rebels in fight.
In case of any more delay the object will be lost, and an easy end
will be obtained with the utmost difficulty hereafter. What can I
write you more than this?<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Feeling himself utterly powerless to resist the demands
of the Barukzyes, for all his principal supporters were
deserting him, the Prince now placed himself in the hands
of Ameen-oollah Khan, who went out to a conference
with Mahomed Shah Khan, which mutual distrust nearly
strangled in the womb, and consented to the first of these
propositions.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Futteh Jung was to be the nominal occupant
of the throne. Akbar Khan was to be minister; and
Ameen-oollah Khan, his Naib, or deputy. It was the
object of the Sirdar to arrest the internal dissensions
which were so weakening the great national and religious
cause, to obtain possession of all the available money and
munitions, and then to carry on the war with new vigour
against the infidels.</p>

<p>But Mahomed Zemaun Khan was the recognised chief
of the Barukzye party; and he now asked on what authority
the Sirdar ventured without his sanction to make
peace with the Suddozyes. There appeared to be every
chance of an open rupture between them; and scarcely
had Akbar Khan concluded his negotiations with the
Prince, then the Newab made a hostile demonstration,
attacked the Balla Hissar, but was beaten back with much
slaughter. It was, however, currently reported that a
secret understanding existed between the two Barukzye
chiefs, whose common object it was to obtain possession
of the Balla Hissar. Two or three days afterwards they
were, outwardly, again united. An attempt had been
made to lure the Prince to an interview with Akbar Khan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
beyond the walls of the Balla Hissar. The Arabs in the
garrison, who remained true to the royal family, dissuaded
the Prince from exposing himself to the treachery of the
Sirdar; mutual distrust soon engendered a rupture between
them; and it was plain, that if some arrangement
could not be promptly made between the Prince and the
Barukzyes, through the agency of the Kuzzilbash chief,
the Balla Hissar, the treasure, and the guns, would
speedily fall into the hands of Akbar Khan and his confederates.</p>

<p>The Barukzyes now laid siege, with redoubled vigour,
to the Balla Hissar. The Prince was well-nigh deserted.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
He called upon Oosman Khan, Shah Soojah’s old minister,
to aid him, but upon some frivolous pretext, the Wuzeer
declined to league himself with so perilous a cause. It
was assiduously given out that the Prince was holding the
Balla Hissar only for the Feringhees; and, as the national
feeling became stronger and stronger against him, if it
had not been for the strength of the place itself, he would
hardly have been able to hold it for a day against the
Barukzyes. But the fortress held out, in spite of the
weakness of the Prince and the garrison; and so at last
the Barukzyes began to undermine the works. “Last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
night,” wrote Futteh Jung to General Pollock, at the
beginning of June, “they made an assault; now they
have made mines in every direction. My affairs are in a
very critical state.... If you do not come quickly, the
Balla Hissar and the throne will be lost, and you will be
a sufferer. At this time I am at my last gasp. Moreover,
there is nothing in the magazine.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Now is the
crisis.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>On the 6th of June, after an ineffectual attempt at
negotiation, Akbar Khan issued orders for the springing
of the mine. But it was not carried sufficiently far to
damage the works.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The explosion killed a large number
of the besiegers; whilst the storming party was driven
back by the garrison with considerable loss. The troops
of the Shah-zadah are said to have “behaved very nobly,
and like heroes, to have defeated the assault.” Mohun
Lal reported, but with some exaggeration, that not less
than 1000 of the followers of Akbar Khan fell upon this
day.</p>

<p>But the elation of the garrison was but short-lived.
On the following day the Barukzyes brought up some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
heavy ordnance and began to cannonade the Balla Hissar.
The defenders then lost heart. The Hindostanee and
Arab fighting men, who composed the bulk of the Prince’s
followers, began to tremble for the safety of their families,
and to call upon Futteh Jung to enter into some accommodation
with their assailants. Thus deserted by his
garrison, who declared that they would open the gates to
the enemy if the Prince did not submit, he had nothing
to do but to abandon the defence, and to suffer the Barukzyes
to enter the Balla Hissar.</p>

<p>With many professions of fidelity and demonstrations
of respect, Akbar Khan presented himself before the
Prince, declared that he had the prosperity of the royal
family at heart, and that he himself was merely the servant
of the Suddozyes. Futteh Jung offered him money;
but he declined it&mdash;offered him a dress of honour, but
he meekly refused to wear it. He wanted nothing, he
said, but the prosperity of the Prince, and he could not
wear the dress of honour until he had adjusted all his
differences with Mahomed Zemaun Khan. But these
differences were not very easily to be adjusted. The
Newab was unwilling to recognise the sovereignty of
Futteh Jung; and was jealous of the rising power of the
Sirdar. Meeting after meeting was held, and many
attempts were made to reconcile the conflicting interests
of the two Barukzye leaders. It was urged, on the one
side, that if Futteh Jung were acknowledged as the
nominal ruler of Afghanistan, all his wealth would be in
the power of the chiefs, and that the war might then be
waged against the infidels with every chance of success.
But, on the other hand, it was asked by the friends of
Zemaun Khan&mdash;and Meer Hadjee, the High Priest,
adopted the same views&mdash;since during the lifetime of Shah
Soojah the Newab had been chosen King by the chiefs
and accepted by the nation, why should they now revert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to the old Suddozye sovereignty, which the country had
so emphatically repudiated?<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>As time advanced, the difficulties in the way of a
reconciliation between the two parties seemed to thicken.
The Newab declared that he was King&mdash;that Akbar Khan
might hold the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan
army, but that Oosman Khan was to be the Wuzeer.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
In the meanwhile, the Sirdar was gaining over the
Kohistanee chiefs, and preparing himself for the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
conflict. But the Kuzzilbashes now refused to
league themselves with Akbar Khan, and talked of joining
the British on their advance. There was no prospect
of a reconciliation of the differences between the two
Barukzye chiefs. The old Newab bitterly deplored the
strife which seemed likely soon to plunge the city again
into the miseries of war, and openly prayed that God
might send General Pollock quickly, so that he and
Akbar might fly from Caubul before they had caused
bloodshed among the people by the violent arbitrement of
their disputes.</p>

<p>Equally did Akbar Khan claim credit for his forbearance.
On the 21st of June, after many fruitless attempts
at an amicable adjustment of affairs, the two factions
came into open collision. A battle was fought; and
“after an insignificant fight of two or three hours’ duration,”
the Newab was defeated. He and his sons were
taken. His house was plundered. The leading chiefs of
his party were seized and subjected to every conceivable
insult. The victory, indeed, was complete; but it was
mainly achieved by the money which had been pillaged
from the treasury of the Prince. Some of the most
influential men of the Newab’s party were bribed over to
desert him; and he found, when it was too late, that he
was betrayed.</p>

<p>The Prince was throned on the 29th of June. But he
exercised no regal power. The Sirdar, who conferred upon
him the title of sovereign mainly to conciliate the Populzyes,
began rapidly to strip him of his wealth, and to
reduce him to a mere pageant and a name.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
possessing himself of all the tangible property upon which
he could lay his hands, he called in all the secretaries and
managers of the royal household, and compelled them to
give an account of their stewardship. He had taken up
his residence in the Balla Hissar; was digging a ditch
around the place; and laying in military stores. He
then began to endeavour to compass the possession of
all the hostages and captives, and to secure them against
the chance of rescue by confining them in the Balla
Hissar.</p>

<p>The situation of the English gentlemen at Caubul,
who had resided so securely under the protection of the
good Newab, now became more critical.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> On the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of Shah Soojah the Caubulees had called upon Zemaun
Khan to deliver them up to Meer Hadjee, the High
Priest. The Newab had long resisted the demand. But
the clamour of the people had drowned his prayers. His
tears and intercessions were fruitless. At last he surrendered
them to the Hadjee, imploring him to treat them
with kindness, and sending at the same time the ladies of
his family to the priest’s house that they might, in some
sort, be a protection to the British captives. Under the
guardianship of Meer Hadjee, Conolly and his associates
remained until the beginning of July. By this time Akbar
Khan was dominant in Caubul. He had determined to
gain possession of the persons of the whole of the English
hostages and prisoners in Afghanistan, and he now began
to importune Meer Hadjee to send them to the Balla
Hissar. Day after day he went, on this errand, to the
High Priest’s house; but for some time his importunities
were fruitless. At last, he tried the effect of money. The
avarice of Meer Hadjee was notorious. Akbar Khan
had bought him over to his cause; and now he bethought
himself of buying the prisoners. He did not bid high for
them. It appears that Akbar Khan offered 4000 rupees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
for the persons of the hostages, and that the offer was
accepted.</p>

<p>The hostages were now conveyed to the Balla Hissar,
where they remained under the immediate custody of
Akbar Khan. Mohun Lal, who had been rendering
good service to the British Government, by keeping the
authorities at Jellalabad continually supplied with information
relative to the events which were passing at
Caubul, was seized by the Sirdar and tortured. The
Moonshee had been residing in the house of the Kuzzilbash
chief, Khan Shereen Khan; but now, early in
July, Akbar Khan, having first seized the person of the
host, contrived to obtain possession of the guest; and
immediately began to extort money from him by the
cruel agency of physical torture. It was not until General
Pollock wrote an urgent letter to Akbar Khan, that
the unhappy Moonshee was relieved from this terrible
persecution.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>In the mean while, the British prisoners, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
in custody at Budeeabad, were in a fort in the neighbourhood
of Caubul. When last I spoke of them they were
halting in the valley of Zandah, where they were detained
for about the space of a month. On the 22nd of May they
received orders to march on the following day for Caubul.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
The road lay along the track of the slaughtered army, and
the putrid corpses sickened the captives as they went.
About three miles from Caubul, on the banks of the
Loghur river, is the fort of Ali Mahomed, a chief of Kuzzilbash
connexions. Here they were lodged in the apartments
recently occupied by the ladies of the chief’s family<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>&mdash;the
best and most commodious quarters which the
prisoners had yet enjoyed.</p>

<p>In Ali Mahomed’s fort the prisoners led a life of comparative
freedom. They had a spacious garden in which
to exercise themselves at certain times. They had the use
alike of the walks and of the fruits. They were suffered
to bathe in the river. They were permitted to visit, and
to receive visits from, their friends in the Balla Hissar.
Many of them had the means of borrowing money from
the Caubulees; and were able to purchase many necessaries
which they had not enjoyed at Budeeabad. Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and papers from Jellalabad, from the provinces of India,
and from old England, were brought to them without
interruption. They had much to think about and much
to discuss. Intelligence from Jellalabad and intelligence
from Caubul came, in some shape, every day. Life was
comparatively but little wearisome; there was abundant
occupation for the mind, and abundant exercise for the
body. True, indeed, it is that many of the party fell
sick, and that some died; that their guards were sometimes
insolent and extortionate; and that ever and anon
there reached them rumours of the intentions of Akbar
Khan to carry them off to Toorkistan; but they had
much to be thankful for, on the other side, and on the
whole, perhaps, they enjoyed greater comfort and happiness,
than commonly fall to the lot of the prisoner and
the captive in the hands of a barbarous foe.</p>

<p class="pch">The Advance from Jellalabad&mdash;Instructions of Lord Ellenborough&mdash;The
Question of Responsibility&mdash;Employment of the Troops at
Jellalabad&mdash;Operations in the Shinwarree Valley&mdash;Negotiations for
the Release of the Prisoners&mdash;The Advance&mdash;Mammoo Khail&mdash;Jugdulluck&mdash;Tezeen&mdash;Occupation
of Caubul.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> summer months passed away, and still left General
Pollock at Jellalabad, and General Nott at Candahar.
Whether it were the intention of the Governor-General
that they should advance upon Caubul, or fall back at
once upon Peshawur and Quettah, was a problem of very
difficult solution. Such data as were afforded them by
the letters of Lord Ellenborough and his secretaries
sufficed only to plunge them into a state of still deeper
bewilderment and mystification. Every fresh letter
seemed to render the obscurity more obscure. The
Governor-General’s instructions to Pollock and Nott at
this time resembled nothing so much as those given to
children in the “game of contraries”&mdash;to hold fast when
they are ordered to let go, and to let go when they are
ordered to hold fast. Lord Ellenborough was, in effect,
perpetually telling the generals that when he suggested
to them to go forward it was their business to come back.</p>

<p>It is probable that Lord Ellenborough himself had no
very clear perception, at this time, of the course which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
purposed to pursue. He had made up his mind, he said,
to save India in spite of every man in it who ought to
give him support;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> but it seemed to be his idea to save
India rather by withdrawing all our troops within the
Sutlej, than by striking a decisive blow for the re-establishment
of our military supremacy in Afghanistan. It
was his opinion that the danger of our position at that
time arose from the absence of so large a body of troops
from the provinces of Hindostan; and that we might
better afford to leave our external injuries unredressed,
than weaken our means of defence in India itself for the
purpose of redressing them. Viewing the matter in this
light, Lord Ellenborough thought less of redeeming the
military character of the British nation than of bringing
back the troops to Hindostan; and he would have
brought them back without an effort at such redemption,
if the almost universal voice, not only of the chief civil
and military officers, but of the Anglo-Indian community
at large, had not been lifted up against so inglorious and
degrading a concession. The opinions and desires of
Pollock and Nott&mdash;of Robertson and Clerk&mdash;of Rawlinson,
Outram, Macgregor, Mackeson, and others, who were
eager for a forward movement, and little inclined to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
their genuine sentiments under a cloak of official
reserve&mdash;how little soever Lord Ellenborough might have
been disposed outwardly to acknowledge their influence&mdash;were
not without their effect. Public opinion he professed
to despise. The judgments of the Press he pretended to
hold in such absolute contempt, that he lived in habitual
ignorance of all that emanated from it; but it is believed
that this disregard of public opinion was rather a profession
than a fact, and that Lord Ellenborough was shaken
in his determination to bring back the armies to the
provinces, by the clamour that, from one end of India to
the other, was raised against the obnoxious measure of
withdrawal. He had by this time, too, received information
from England that an inglorious retirement from
the scene of our late humiliation, and the abandonment
of all the brave men, tender women, and innocent children,
in the hands of the Afghans, would be viewed with no satisfaction
either by his old ministerial colleagues, or by the
people of Great Britain. Many powerful external influences,
therefore, roused him to a sense of the necessity of doing
something in advance; but the “withdrawal policy” was
emphatically his own, and he was resolute to preserve the
shadow of it if he could not maintain the substance.</p>

<p>In this conjuncture, he betook himself to an expedient
unparalleled, perhaps, in the political history of the
world. He instigated Pollock and Nott to advance, but
insisted that they should regard the forward movement
solely in the light of a retirement from Afghanistan. No
change had come over the views of Lord Ellenborough,
but a change had come over the meaning of certain words
of the English language. The Governor-General had
resolutely maintained that the true policy of the English
Government was to bring back our armies to the provinces
of India, and that nothing would justify him in
pushing them forward merely for the re-establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
our military reputation. But he found it necessary to
yield to the pressure from without, and to push the
armies of Pollock and Nott further into the heart of the
Afghan dominions. To preserve his own consistency,
and at the same time to protect himself against the
measureless indignation of the communities both of India
and of England, was an effort of genius beyond the reach
of ordinary statesmen. But it was not beyond the grasp
of Lord Ellenborough. How long he may have been
engaged on the solution of the difficulty before him,
History cannot determine. But on the 4th of July it
was finally accomplished. On that day Lord Ellenborough,
who had entirely discarded the official mediation
of the Commander-in-Chief, despatched two letters to
General Pollock and two to General Nott. In these
letters he set forth that his opinions had undergone no
change since he had declared the withdrawal of the
British armies to the provinces to be the primal object of
Government; but he suggested that perhaps General
Nott might feel disposed to retire from Candahar to the
provinces of India by the route of Ghuznee, Caubul, and
Jellalabad;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and that perhaps General Pollock might feel
disposed to assist the retreat of the Candahar force by
moving forward upon Caubul.</p>

<p>It has been seen, that on the 1st of June Lord Ellenborough
had granted General Pollock a constructive
permission to remain at Jellalabad until the month of
October; and that General Pollock had determined to
turn this permission to the best account. The mind of
the statesman was running on retirement; the mind of
the soldier on advance. The great obstacle either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
retirement or to advance had been the scarcity of carriage.
But in the early summer months every exertion had been
made by the authorities in Upper India to procure carriage
for the use of the armies in Afghanistan. Lord
Ellenborough had exerted himself to obtain cattle; Mr.
Robertson, the able and energetic Lieutenant-Governor
of the North-Western Provinces, had exerted himself to
obtain cattle.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The Governor-General threw his heart
into the work, because he was eager to bring back the
armies to Hindostan; the Lieutenant-Governor threw his
heart into the work, because he was eager to push them
on to Caubul. So it happened, that before the end of
June, there was a sufficiency of cattle at General Pollock’s
disposal to enable him to do something; and he reported
to Government that his means of movement were such
that he was able to make a demonstration in the neighbourhood
of Jellalabad. Upon this, Lord Ellenborough,
through his secretary, wrote to him on the 4th of July
that he was rejoiced to hear, the General was able to do
something; but that he (the General) must, on no account,
think that any change had come over the opinions of
Government, which still inclined resolutely towards the
withdrawal of the army at the earliest moment consistent
with the health and efficiency of the troops.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>On this same 4th of July the Governor-General wrote
twice to General Nott&mdash;once through his secretary and
once with his own hand. He sent the General a copy of
his instructions to Pollock, impressing upon him that all
his views were in favour of a prompt withdrawal; and
he addressed to him a long inconclusive letter, instructing
him to withdraw from Afghanistan, but telling him, at
the same time, that the line of withdrawal was to be left
to his own choice. He might retire by going backward,
by Quettah and Sukkur, or he might retire by going
forward, by Ghuznee, Caubul, and Jellalabad. But
whichsoever line he might take, he was never for a
moment to lose sight of the fact that Lord Ellenborough
had decreed that he should retire, and that retire he
must.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>It was fortunate for Lord Ellenborough and for the
country that he had to deal at this time with men who
thought more of the honour of Great Britain than of
their own safety; and who did not shrink from responsibility,
if, by incurring it, they had a reasonable chance
of conferring great and lasting benefits upon the government
which they served, and the nation which they represented.
But Lord Ellenborough’s instructions to the
Generals were so worded&mdash;whether by accident or by
design I do not presume to determine&mdash;as to cast upon
them all the onus of failure, and to confer upon the Governor-General,
or at least to divide with him, all the
honour of success. One thing at least is certain&mdash;the
letter of the 4th of July, addressed to General Nott and
signed by the Chief Secretary, ought not to have been
written. It is either from first to last a masterpiece of
Jesuitical cunning, or it indicates a feebleness of will&mdash;an
infirmity of purpose&mdash;discreditable to the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a statesman entrusted with the welfare and the honour of
one of the greatest empires in the world.</p>

<p>But, whatever may have been the amount of responsibility
cast upon the two Generals, neither Pollock nor
Nott shrunk from it. They cheerfully took up the
burden and placed it on their own shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> They had
obtained now all that they wanted. They had no doubt
of the ability of their troops to carry everything before
them. Cattle had been supplied, or were being supplied,
sufficient for all their movements. It was only necessary
that they should act in concert with each other&mdash;that
they should so combine their operations as to reach the
capital at the same time, and strike the last blow together.
But it was no easy thing in those days to carry
on a correspondence between Jellalabad and Candahar;
and it was long before Pollock received an answer to his
letters. Five messengers were despatched in succession
to Nott’s camp;<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> but it was not before the middle of
August that Pollock could assure himself of his brother-general’s
intentions to advance upon Caubul at all.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean while, neither General had been wholly
inactive. At Jellalabad, Pollock had been making a
demonstration against some hostile tribes, and carrying
on negotiations for the release of the British prisoners.
The Governor-General had several times, in rather obscure
language, suggested to Pollock that it might be desirable
to strike a blow at some one somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Jellalabad; and now the General sent out Monteith
into the Shinwarree valley to read a lesson to the
tribes who had possessed themselves of the property plundered
from our army, and who held in their hands one
of our captured guns. These things were to be now
demanded from the tribes, or to be wrested from them
at the point of the bayonet. In the middle of June,
Monteith descended into the valley, with a brigade of
European and Native troops, and a sufficiency of guns
for his purpose. The troops, so long held in restraint,
were now all fire and impetuosity. The first sight, in
the village of Ali-Boghan, of some property that had
belonged to our slaughtered army, maddened them past
control.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> They began at once to fire the houses and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
plunder the inhabitants. But Monteith and Macgregor
interfered for their protection. The plundered property
was restored. Even the money that had been taken was
made over again to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The report of the violence that had been committed at
Ali-Boghan spread like wildfire through the valley. The
people believed that the British troops were about to fire
all the villages; so they began at once to remove their
property, and to fly in every direction from their homes.
Macgregor exerted himself to restore confidence among
them, by explaining the real designs of his government;
and the people began to return to their dwellings. But,
although indiscriminate plunder and destruction were not
the objects of the expedition, the brigade had been sent
out to do certain work, and it soon became evident that it
could not be done without inflicting some injury upon the
people. The captured gun and the plundered property
were to be recovered. It was known that two of the
principal chiefs of a place called Goolai were in possession
of a portion of the treasure that had fallen into the hands
of our enemies. It was known, too, that the captured gun
was at Deh-Surruk. It was determined, therefore, that
the brigade should move against these two places.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th of June, Monteith moved
upon Goolai. “It presented all the appearance of a
flourishing little settlement. Several of the forts were
extensive and in good repair. They were shaded by
clusters of mulberry and willow trees. Flowing water
passed close to the forts, and served to irrigate the neighbouring
fields of cotton, rice, and jewaree. The summer
harvest had just been collected, and was stocked outside
the fort in its unwinnowed state. The inhabitants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
evidently only time to escape with their portable property
before the troops reached Goolai. In fact, our visit was
most timely. Three or four days’ delay would have
enabled them to carry off their grain.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Monteith pitched his camp on some rising ground near
the village, and demanded the restitution of the plundered
treasure. On the following day evasive answers were
received; there was no prospect of obtaining, by peaceful
negotiation, the concession that was demanded from the
chiefs. So the work of destruction commenced. Their
forts and houses were destroyed. Their walls were blown
up. Their beautiful trees were ringed and left to perish.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The retribution was complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of destruction went on for some days. In
the mean while the captured gun had been given up, and
the people of Deh-Surruk were willing to restore the
treasure which they had taken; but they could not easily
recover it from the real possessors. However, after some
difficulty, upwards of 10,000 rupees, besides other property,
were recovered from the Shinwarrees. A large
quantity of grain, timber, boosa, and other requisites was
appropriated at Goolai; and it was supposed that the
declared objects of the expedition had now been fully
accomplished.</p>

<p>But the Shinwarrees had not been thoroughly coerced.
They had always been a refractory people&mdash;unwilling to
pay revenue either to Barukzye chief or Suddozye Prince.
It was thought advisable, therefore, to read them a more
severe lesson. So Monteith made a progress through the
valley, applied the firebrand to their forts, and shot them
down in their places of refuge. “At one time the interiors
of five-and-thirty forts were in a blaze along the
valley.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> At a place named Mazeena the tribes made
some show of resistance; but the steady gallantry of her
Majesty’s 31st Regiment and of their Sepoy comrades
was not to be withstood; the shells from Abbott’s howitzers
were irresistible; and so Monteith effectually beat down
the opposition of the Shinwarrees. This was on the 26th
of July. On the 3rd of August the brigade returned to
Jellalabad. From the 17th of June to this date, “both
men and cattle had entirely subsisted on the resources of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the country.” “The cattle especially,” added Captain
Macgregor, concluding his report, “will be found to have
greatly improved in condition while employed on this
service. Indeed, in whatever way it may be viewed, it
will be found that the expedition has been highly beneficial
to British interests.”</p>

<p>Whilst Monteith was carrying on these operations in
the Shinwarree valley, Pollock was carrying on negotiations
for the release of the British prisoners. On the
10th of July, Mackenzie having been stricken down by
fever and lying, as was supposed, at the point of death,
Captain Troup, accompanied by a native gentleman,
named Hadjee Buktear, had been despatched to General
Pollock’s camp; but had brought back no satisfactory
intelligence to encourage and animate the Sirdar.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The
fact is, that Pollock had by this time begun to see his way
to Caubul. Lord Ellenborough and Mr. Robertson had
exerted themselves most successfully to supply him with
carriage. He was eager to plant the British standard on
the Balla Hissar, and was unwilling to hamper himself with
any negotiations which might impede or delay his advance.
It was thought by some in Pollock’s camp that the Sirdar
was not sincere in his overtures, and that his real object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
was to gain time. But Pollock was equally anxious to
gain time. The emissaries were not dismissed in a hurry;
and when they returned at last to Caubul they carried
back only a verbal message, and that message contained
a demand for all the guns and trophies in the possession
of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> It was expected that another reference
would be made to Jellalabad; and that in the mean
while Pollock would be supplied with the means of rescuing
the prisoners more majestically than by such negotiations.
He had received so many assurances from influential
men at the capital that the Caubulees would not suffer
Akbar Khan to carry off the prisoners to Toorkistan, that
he believed the advance of his army would tend more
surely to their release than any diplomatic measure which
he could possibly adopt.</p>

<p>But Akbar Khan held a different opinion. When
Troup returned to Caubul, the Sirdar summoned him and
Pottinger to an interview, declared that he was not satisfied
with Pollock’s verbal message, and candidly asked
their advice. Pottinger replied that the best advice he
could offer was, that Akbar Khan should immediately
send down the whole of the prisoners to Pollock’s camp
at Jellalabad, as a proof of his sincerity and good feeling.
If there were any delay, he added, the negotiations would
be broken off, and the army would advance. To this
the Sirdar replied, that without a written promise from
General Pollock to withdraw his troops from Afghanistan
the prisoners would not be sent to his camp; and that
they might at once banish the thought of a forcible
release of the prisoners on the advance of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
army, for that as soon as intelligence should reach him of
our troops having arrived at Charbagh, he would send
them all off to Toorkistan&mdash;scattering them about by
twos and threes among the different chiefs&mdash;and come
down himself with his fighting men to dispute the progress
of the advancing army.</p>

<p>To Pollock, this appeared a mere idle threat. He still
clung to the belief that there was a party in Caubul able
and willing to prevent the departure of the prisoners;
and when Troup, accompanied by Lawrence, came down
again to Jellalabad, he found the General still less inclined
than before to promise to withdraw his army. He had,
indeed, already moved a brigade forward to Futtehabad&mdash;two
marches in advance of his old position; and Sale,
who commanded this brigade, had written that it was “a
good place for a fight.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> All that Pollock, therefore, could
now promise was, that he would not advance beyond that
point before the expiration of a certain number of days.
The negotiations had, by this time, become the merest
sham. It was obvious that Pollock could not proceed with
them to a successful issue without encumbering himself
with conditions which would have hung as a millstone
round the neck of a military commander, eager to drive
his battalions into the heart of the enemy’s country. The
Governor-General wrote to him that “all military operations
must proceed, as if no negotiations were on foot;” but
Akbar Khan had rendered this impossible, by demanding,
as a condition of the delivery of the prisoners, that all the
British troops should withdraw from Afghanistan.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Weary of these protracted negotiations, Pollock was
now eager to advance upon Caubul. He was only waiting
the arrival of specific information from Candahar relative
to the movements of his brother-general. “As I have
offered to meet him,” he wrote to a friend in high place,
“he will find some difficulty in resisting the <i>glorious</i>
temptation; but if he does resist, he is not the man I
take him for.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The glorious temptation was not resisted.
The two Generals were worthy of each other. Nott had
determined to retire to India by Ghuznee, Caubul, and
Jellalabad; and in the middle of the month of August, a
messenger, long expected and most welcome, brought the
cheering intelligence into Pollock’s camp.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th of August, Pollock began to move from
Jellalabad. On that day the advanced guard under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
General himself reached Sultanpore, on its way to
Gundamuck. At the latter place he intended to assemble
the whole of the troops which he had selected to accompany
him to the capital<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>&mdash;in all, about 8000 men. On
the 23rd, Pollock, with the advance, reached Gundamuck.
About two miles from that place lies the village of
Mammoo Khail. Two hostile chiefs, having sent away all
their women and children, had mustered a strong body of
the Ooloos, and were occupying this position. Pollock at
once determined to dislodge them; and ordered up from
Sale’s camp in the rear Broadfoot’s sappers and a squadron
of dragoons. On the following morning the brigade
advanced, and the enemy began to retire. Then, dividing
his infantry into two columns, with a wing of her Majesty’s
9th Foot at the head of each, Pollock entered the village.
The enemy had abandoned their positions there, and at
another village, called Koochlee Khail; but they rallied
and returned to occupy a range of heights within musket-shot
of the latter place, and from these commanding
eminences, they kept up, for some time, a hot fire from
their jezails. But Colonel Taylor attacked them on one
side; Broadfoot, with his sappers, on the other.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The
heights were carried. The forts and villages were taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the enemy dispersed. The chiefs fled to Caubul with a
few followers. Mammoo Khail and Koochlee Khail were
destroyed by fire; and the fruit-trees were cut down.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Having accomplished this, Pollock returned to Gundamuck.
The attack on Mammoo Khail, which is not
on the road to Caubul, was a diversion rendered necessary
by the appearance of the enemy in that direction. But
the General had yet to assemble his entire force, to assure
himself of the sufficiency of his supplies, and to make all
the necessary arrangements for his advance upon the
capital. The delight with which the announcement of
the intended advance upon Caubul had been received
throughout the general camp is not to be described. The
question of advance or withdrawal had been for months
eagerly discussed. Every symptom had been watched
with the closest interest&mdash;every report had been canvassed
with wondering curiosity. Acting under instructions
from the Supreme Government, Pollock had kept
all his intended movements a close secret. It was not,
indeed, until the middle of August that even Sir Robert
Sale knew that the force would advance upon Caubul;
and then he was so wild with excitement that he could
scarcely write a note to the General to express his unbounded
delight.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>There were now no longer any doubts regarding the
forward movement of the force. Officers and men were
eager to push on to Caubul; and willing to advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
lightly equipped, leaving behind them all the baggage
that was not absolutely necessary to their efficiency.
The 13th Light Infantry, ever ready to set an example
to their comrades, sent back a considerable portion of
their baggage to Jellalabad, and prepared to march with
only a single change of linen. The officers of the regiment
were content to congregate, three or four together,
in small hill tents; and Broadfoot, at all times a pattern
of chivalrous zeal, offered to take on his sappers without
any tents at all.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Full of hope and courage the troops moved up, by
brigades, to Gundamuck. Making all his arrangements
for the march, and waiting intelligence from Nott,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Pollock remained at that place until the 7th of September.
Supplies were pouring freely into camp. The rich
orchards and fruit-gardens of the surrounding country
yielded their luscious produce; and our officers were
writing to their friends that they were “luxuriating
quietly on the most delicious fruits and supplies of all
kinds.” The neighbouring chiefs were coming in and
making submission to the English General. It was
plain that already the tidings of our advance were
striking terror into the hearts of the chiefs and people of
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>It was on the 1st day of September, when Pollock was
awaiting at Gundamuck the assembling of his brigades,
that an Afghan, of forlorn aspect, in soiled and tattered
clothes, rode upon a wretched pony, attended by three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
followers, into the British camp. Two officers of the
general staff, Burn and Mayne, met the stranger as he
approached, and recognised him. They knew him to be
Futteh Jung. They knew him to be the man who, a day
or two before, had borne the title of King of Caubul.
The fugitive was kindly received, and conducted to the
General’s tent. A salute was fired in his honour. Accommodation
was provided for him in the British camp,
and everything that could conduce to his comfort was
freely granted to the unfortunate Prince.</p>

<p>For some time, Futteh Jung had been a wretched
puppet at the Caubul Court. He had been but a King
of straw. The merest shadow of royalty had been suffered
to cling to him. Akbar Khan, for his own uses, held the
imbecile Prince firmly in his hands; and every day
tightened his grasp. He stripped him of all his power;
he stripped him of all his wealth. He threatened&mdash;he
overawed him. He compelled him to attach his seal, or
his signature,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> to papers resigning all authority into the
hands of the Wuzeer, and signifying his assent to everything
that might be originated or sanctioned by him.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Deeming that the unscrupulous tyranny of Akbar Khan
would soon manifest itself in the murder of the whole royal
family, the Prince directed his thoughts towards the expediency
of flight, and determined to claim the hospitality
of the British General. But Akbar Khan suspected his
intentions, and flung him into close confinement in the
Balla Hissar. A Kuzzilbash gentleman, named Aga
Mahomed, aided him to escape from his perilous captivity.
A hole was cut through the roof of his prison, and he
emerged into the outer air. But, overcome by terror and
by opium, his limbs refused to perform their office, and on
his perilous way to the Kuzzilbash quarters, he more than
once implored his deliverer to carry him back to his place
of captivity. The resolution, however, of Aga Mahomed
prevailed, and, having lodged the wretched Prince for a
while in the house of a Kuzzilbash lady&mdash;the Aga’s aunt&mdash;he
raised a few thousand rupees by pledging his own
and his mother’s property, and then started him on his
perilous journey to the camping-ground of the British.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
With some difficulty, often fired upon as he went, Futteh
Jung made his way through the passes; and at last, on
the 1st of September, struggled into Pollock’s camp.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th of September, General
Pollock, with the first division of his army, accompanied
by General Sir Robert Sale, moved from Gundamuck,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
in progress to the capital. The second division, under
General M’Caskill, marched on the following day. A
party of the Sikh contingent, under Captain Lawrence,
accompanied this division. These regiments had been
sent up to Jellalabad in June, and had been encamped
on the opposite side of the river. They were the old
Mussulman corps who had behaved so infamously on
the other side of the Khybur, but who now had been
talked over by Gholab Singh into something like propriety
of demeanour.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> They behaved at least as well as
the British General expected, and when Lawrence sought
permission for a party of 500 men, horse and foot, to
accompany, under his directions, Pollock’s army to
Caubul, the General was but little inclined to refuse the
request. So a party of 300 horse and 200 foot marched,
under Lawrence, with M’Caskill’s division; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
remainder occupied positions at Neemlah and Gundamuck.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September, as the first division of Pollock’s
army approached the hills which commanded the
road through the Jugdulluck Pass, he found that their
summits were occupied by the enemy. Large bodies of
Ghilzyes, under different chieftains, each with a distinguishing
standard, were clustering on the heights.
“The hills they occupied formed an amphitheatre inclining
towards the left of the road, on which the troops
were halted whilst the guns opened, and the enemy were
thus enabled on this point to fire into the column, a
deep ravine preventing any contact with them.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The
practice of the guns was excellent; but the Ghilzye
warriors stood their ground. The shells from our
howitzers burst among them; but still they held their
posts. Still they poured in a hot fire from their jezails.
So Pollock sent his infantry to the attack; and gallantly
they ascended the heights. On one side, Broadfoot,
ever in advance, led up his little band of sappers. On
the other, Taylor, with the 9th Foot, ascended the hills,
where the enemy, horse and foot, were posted behind a
ruined fort. In the centre, Wilkinson, with the 13th,
pushed up the ascent towards the key of the enemy’s
position. All went forward with impetuous gallantry;
and as they clomb the hill-sides and seized the Ghilzye
standards, up went an animated and enthusiastic cheer
from the British stormers. It was plain that their heart
was in the work, and that nothing could turn them
back. The flower of the Ghilzye tribes were there,
under many of their most renowned chieftains, and they
looked down upon the scene of their recent sanguinary
triumphs. But they had now to deal with other men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
under other leaders. The loud clear cry of the British
infantry struck a panic into their souls. They turned
and fled before our bayonets. Then galloped Lockwood
with his dragoons after the enemy’s horse; but the
nature of the ground was against him, and they escaped
the annihilation which otherwise would have been their
fate.</p>

<p>But the battle was not yet over. A considerable
body of the enemy had betaken themselves for safety to
an apparently inaccessible height. On the summit of a
mountain they planted their standards, and seemed to
look down with defiance upon our troops. But Pollock
was resolute not to leave, on that day, his work incomplete.
He believed that where the enemy could post
themselves his infantry could attack them. So, under
cover of Abbott’s and Backhouse’s guns, Broadfoot and
Wilkinson again led up their men, and stormed that
precipitous height. “Seldom have soldiers had a more
arduous task to perform, and never was an undertaking
of the kind surpassed in execution.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The Ghilzyes
looked down upon them with astonishment and dismay.
They saw at once the temper of our men, and they
shrunk from the encounter. Our stormers pushed on,
and the Ghilzye standards were lowered. The enemy fled
in confusion; and left the stronghold, from which they
had looked down in the insolence of mistaken security, to
be occupied by British troops.</p>

<p>The victory was complete. It was mainly achieved,
under Pollock’s able directions, by the brave men of
the old Jellalabad garrison. Sale himself, who was
never far off when there was likely to be hard fighting,
led up the heights in front of his old regiment, and was
wounded in the affray. The loss upon our side was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
trifling. Nothing could have told more plainly than
such a victory as this how little formidable in reality
were the best Ghilzye fighting men in their most inaccessible
strongholds, when opposed to British infantry
under the eye of a capable commander. The Ghilzye
butchers were now seen flying like sheep before the
comrades of the men whom a few months before they had
slaughtered in these very shambles at Jugdulluck.</p>

<p>The first division alone of Pollock’s army was engaged
with the enemy at Jugdulluck.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The second
division passed on, much molested by the enemy, and
often compelled to fight its way against large bodies of
Ghilzye footmen. On the 11th of September they joined
the advance in the neighbourhood of Tezeen. The
exertions of a forced march had fatigued M’Caskill’s
cattle; so Pollock determined to devote the 12th to a
halt. Before the day had closed, it was evident that
the enemy were close at hand, and that we were on the
eve of a great struggle. Akbar Khan had been true to
his word. He had despatched the bulk of the English
prisoners to the Hindoo-Koosh, and was now preparing
to meet our army. On the 6th of September he had
moved his camp to Begramee&mdash;distant some six miles
from the Balla Hissar&mdash;and there sent for Captain
Troup.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The English officer repaired to the camp of
the Sirdar, who summoned a meeting of the principal
chiefs. The Newab Zemaun Khan, Jubbar Khan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Ameen-oollah Khan, Mahomed Shah Khan, and other
chief people of the empire attended the council. Troup
was not permitted to be present at the conference; but
he soon learnt its result. He was required immediately
to proceed to Gundamuck on a mission to Pollock’s
camp. The chiefs had determined to endeavour to
conciliate the British General. They were willing to
agree to any terms he might please to dictate, if he would
only consent to stay the advance of his army upon the
capital.</p>

<p>Troup declared his willingness to proceed on the mission.
But he had no hope, he said, of its success. The
time for negotiation had passed. Nothing could now
stay the progress of Pollock’s army but the entire
destruction of his force. But so urgently did the Sirdar
press his request on the British officer, that Troup could
not refuse his assent to the proposal. He made his preparations
for the journey, and then returned to the
Afghan camp. There, in the presence of Akbar Khan
and Mahomed Shah Khan, he again set forth the uselessness
of the mission, and prevailed with them to

<p>There was nothing now left for the Sirdar but to appeal
to the God of battles, and bring all the force that
he could muster to oppose the progress of Pollock’s
army through the passes. He now moved down to
Boodkhak, and from that place summoned Troup and
Bygrave to his camp. It appeared to him that the
English officers might render him essential service in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
negotiation of terms, if the tide of victory turned against
him. On the morning of the 11th they entered his
camp at Boodkhak. That evening he summoned them
to his presence, and was for some time in earnest
consultation with them. He declared that he had no
wish to oppose the progress of the British army, but
that he had compromised himself too far to recede,
and that the people would not hear of submission. The
English officers assured him that his defeat was certain;
and that opposition to our advance would only occasion
an useless expenditure of life. “I know,” said the Sirdar,
“that I have everything to lose; but it is too late to
recede.” He declared that he was indifferent as to the
result. The issue of the contest was in the hands of
God, and it little mattered to him who was the victor.</p>

<p>On the following morning he sent for Troup, and announced
that he and Bygrave must accompany him to
Koord-Caubul. Arrived at that place, intelligence of
the intended halt of Pollock’s army at Tezeen reached
the Sirdar. The Afghan chiefs had intended to make
their last decisive stand at Koord-Caubul; but the halt
of the advancing army seemed to indicate indecision, and
it was rumoured that difficulties had arisen to obstruct
the progress of the force. On this, the Sirdar at once
determined to move on to Tezeen; and sent to Troup to
announce his intentions.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The English officer sought
and obtained permission to return to Ali Mahomed’s fort;
and Akbar Khan went forward to do battle with the
British.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th the two forces met. Great were the
advantages of the ground to the Afghan levies. The
valley of Tezeen is commanded on all sides by lofty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
hills; and the chiefs had posted their jezailchees on
every available height. Indeed, on that morning of
the 13th of September, Pollock’s camp was encircled by
the enemy; and it was plain that every effort had been
made to turn the natural defences of the country to the
best possible account. There was a hard day’s work
before Pollock’s army; but never were a finer body of
troops in finer condition, or more eager for the work
before them. All arms had now a chance of distinguishing
themselves&mdash;the cavalry on the plain, the
infantry on the hills, and the artillery everywhere. Fortunately
the enemy’s horse entered the valley, attracted
by the hope of plundering our baggage. The opportunity
so eagerly desired by the dragoons was now at
hand. A British squadron, gallantly led by Unett, was
let loose upon the Afghan horsemen. The Native
cavalry followed. There was a brilliant and successful
charge. The enemy turned and fled; but the sabres of
the dragoons fell heavily upon them; and many were
cut up in the flight.</p>

<p>The infantry were not less successful. Gallantly they
ascended the heights on either side of the pass, and
gallantly the Afghans advanced to meet them. The
stormers of the 13th Light Infantry clomb the hills on the
right; the 9th and 31st on the left; and as they went,
hotly and thick upon them poured the iron rain from
the Afghan jezails. But never, beneath the terrible fire
that greeted them, as they pushed up the hill-side, did
these intrepid soldiers waver for a moment. They knew
that their muskets were no match for the Afghan jezails.
The enemy, indeed, seemed to deride them. So having
reached the hill-top, our men fixed their bayonets, and
charged with a loud hurrah. The cold steel took no
denial. Down went the Afghan marksmen before the
English bayonets; the foremost men stood to be pierced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and the rest, awed by the fall of their comrades and the
desperate resolution of the British troops, fled down the
hill in confusion. The strength of the Afghan force was
broken; but the work of our fighting men was not done.
All through the day a desultory warfare was kept up
along the ridges of these tremendous hills. The Afghans
occupying the highest ground, fired down upon our infantry,
hiding themselves when they could behind the
rocks, and shrinking now from a closer contest. Never
did British troops display a higher courage in action, or a
more resolute perseverance. Nobly did the Native Sepoy
vie with the European soldier; and nowhere was there a
finer sight than where Broadfoot with his sappers clambered
up the steepest ascents under the hottest fire, and
drove before them the stalwart Afghans&mdash;giants beside
the little Goorkhas who pressed so bravely upon them.
Many gallant feats were done that day; and many an
Afghan warrior died the hero’s death on his native hills,
cheered by the thought that he was winning Paradise
by such martyrdom. Desperate was the effort to keep
back the invaders from clearing the heights of the Huft-Kotul;
but the British troops, on that day, would
have borne down even stouter opposition. The Huft-Kotul
was mounted; and three cheers burst from
the victors as they reached the summit of that stupendous
ascent.</p>

<p>A more decisive victory was never gained. The Afghan
chiefs had brought out their best fighting men
against us. They had done their best to turn the difficulties
of the country to good account against the strangers.
Their people were at home in these tremendous defiles;
whilst few of our troops had ever seen them&mdash;few were
accustomed to the kind of warfare which now alone could
avail. There was everything to stir into intense action
all the energies of the Barukzye chief and his followers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
They were fighting in defence of their hearths and
altars; the very existence of the nation was at stake.
It was the last hope of saving the capital from the grasp
of an avenging army. But with everything to stimulate
and everything to aid him, Akbar Khan could offer no
effectual resistance to the advance of Pollock’s retributory
force. The Afghans were fairly beaten on their
own ground, and in their own peculiar style of warfare.
It has been often said that our troops were maddened by
the sight of the skeletons of their fallen comrades, and
that they were carried on by the irrepressible energy
of revenge. It is true, that all along the line of country,
from Gundamuck to Koord-Caubul, there rose up before
the eyes of our advancing countrymen hideous evidences
of the great January massacre&mdash;enough to kindle the
fiercest passions in the hearts of the meekest men. But
I believe that, if no such ghastly spectacles had lain in
the path of the advancing army, the forward feeling would
have glowed as strongly in the breasts of every soldier of
Pollock’s force.</p>

<p>The struggle was now at an end. Akbar Khan saw
that the game was up, and that it was useless to attempt
to bring together the scattered fragments of his routed
army. Taking Captain Bygrave with him as the companion
of his flight, he fled to the Ghorebund valley.
The fighting men, who had opposed us at Tezeen, were
now in disordered masses, hurrying homewards along
their mountain paths, and seeking safety in places remote
from the track of the avenging army, whilst Pollock
marched onwards with his regiments in orderly array,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and on the 15th of September encamped on the Caubul
race-course.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[May-September: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Advance from Candahar&mdash;The Relief of Khelat-i-Ghilzye&mdash;Reappearance
of Aktur Khan&mdash;General Action with the Douranees&mdash;Surrender
of Sufder Jung&mdash;The Evacuation of Candahar&mdash;Disaster
near Mookoor&mdash;The Battle of Goaine&mdash;The Recapture of
Ghuznee&mdash;Flight of Shumshoodeen Khan&mdash;Arrival at Caubul.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Whilst</span> the force under General Pollock was fighting
its way from Jellalabad to Caubul, and carrying everything
before it, the Candahar division, under General Nott,
was making a victorious march upon the same point along
the countries to the westward.</p>

<p>But it is necessary that, before I trace its progress to
the capital, the circumstances which preceded the evacuation
of Candahar should be briefly narrated. It
has been stated that, in obedience to the instructions
contained in the government letters of the 19th of
April, a brigade under Colonel Wymer had been despatched
to Khelat-i-Ghilzye, to rescue the garrison there
beleaguered, and to destroy the defences of the place.
On the 19th of May, Wymer’s force left Candahar. It
seems that the Ghilzyes had obtained information of the
intended movement, and determined to anticipate the
attempted relief by making a desperate, and, as they
believed, decisive assault upon the place. Accordingly,
they prepared a number of scaling-ladders, practised
escalading, and, in the dim twilight of early morning
on the 21st of May, advanced in two heavy columns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
each 2000 strong, to the attack. Ascending the mound
where the slope was easiest, they placed their scaling-ladders
against the walls, and gallantly mounted to the
assault. Three times they ascended to the crest of the
works, and three times they were nobly repulsed by
Craigie and his men. The heavy showers of grape and
musket-shot which the garrison poured in upon them,
did not deter those desperate assailants&mdash;they went on
again and again to the attack, and were bayoneted on
the parapets. For more than an hour this desperate
struggle lasted; and then the assailants, whose impetuous
courage had been overmatched by the steady gallantry
of Craigie’s garrison, gave way and abandoned the assault.
The failure was dearly purchased. More than a
hundred dead bodies were found at the foot of the works;
and it was computed that the entire loss of the enemy did
not fall short of five hundred men. Not a man of the
British garrison was killed.</p>

<p>Before sunset the Ghilzyes had dispersed. Colonel
Wymer, when he reached Khelat-i-Ghilzye, had nothing to
do but quietly to withdraw the garrison, and to destroy
the works of the place. It was believed that the measure,
as indicating the intentions of the British Government to
withdraw from Afghanistan, would create considerable sensation
throughout the country, and greatly embolden the
enemy. But the Afghans seemed rather to wonder why
we had not extricated the garrison of Khelat-i-Ghilzye
before, and did not associate it with any ideas of the
general policy to be pursued by the British.</p>

<p>But before Wymer had returned from the northward,
the Douranees had again made trial of their strength
in the field, and had again been signally beaten. Aktur
Khan, the Zemindawer chief, who throughout the preceding
year had been keeping the western districts of
Afghanistan in a state of continual turmoil, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
more than once given battle to our troops, was now
again in the field against us. He had, since his return
from Herat, whither he had betaken himself for safety,
watched the progress of events without openly committing
himself, and had hitherto shown little disposition
to link himself with the Douranee cause. Indeed,
at the beginning of May he had made overtures to the
British authorities, and offered, if they would confirm
him in the government of Zemindawer, to attack the
Douranee camp. As the month advanced, his conduct
became more and more mysterious. He was in constant
communication with the Douranee chiefs, and yet
at the same time he was professing the strongest friendship
for the British Government, and offering to break
up the Douranee camp. But before the expiration of
the month he threw off the mask, joined his brother-chiefs
with a considerable body of fighting men, and
took the command of the van-guard of the Douranee force.</p>

<p>It was obvious now that we were on the eve of
another conflict. The Ghazees moved down on the Urghundab,
and made arrangements to concentrate their
troops in the neighbourhood of Baba-Wullee. It seemed
probable that they would be able to raise the neighbouring
tribes against us; and bring into the field a body
of 4000 or 5000 men. Weakened by the absence of
Wymer’s brigade, and remembering the danger to which
the city had been exposed when he last moved out to
attack the Douranee camp, Nott determined to halt the
detachment which he was about to despatch to the Kojuck
to bring up the carnage which had been assembled for
the withdrawal of his force. The enemy had chosen their
time wisely and well. They believed that, in the absence
of some of his best regiments, and nearly the whole of
his cavalry force, Nott would be little able to hold Candahar
and to do battle with the Douranee force in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
open field. So they neared the city; and on the 29th of
May seemed to invite the contest.</p>

<p>Aktur Khan had drawn into his hands the chief
control of the force. What were his designs, at this
time, it is not easy to determine. On the 27th he had
again made overtures to the British authorities, offering
to seize Meerza Ahmed, and to do his best to dissolve
the Douranee force. At all events, if he could not
accomplish this, he would, he said, on the first attack of the
British, draw off his own followers, and then, taking advantage
of their discomfiture, fall on their rear and plunder
their baggage. But these offers were thrown away upon
Nott and Rawlinson. They had no faith in the man.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 29th of May the enemy
began to appear in the neighbourhood of Candahar&mdash;hovering
about the cantonments, and carrying off our
baggage-cattle. As the day advanced, their numbers
increased; but it was still believed by the General that
they were only reconnoitring our position, and that
they would not then give battle to our troops. Under
this impression, Colonel Stacy, with two regiments of
infantry and four guns, had been sent out to sweep
away the intruders. It happened that his movements
deceived the enemy. Believing at one time that he was
retreating, the Ghazees pushed forward and occupied
some rocky heights to the west of our cantonments, from
which they opened a distant fire on our line. These
movements were seen from the city.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> It was obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that the enemy were determined to bring on an engagement.
So Nott sent out the 41st Queen’s and eight
guns; and an hour after mid-day mounted his horse and
rode out to take the command of his troops. Rawlinson
went with him.</p>

<p>Covered by the fire of the guns, the light companies
were now ordered to storm the heights. The work was
done rapidly and well. Standing out in bold relief
against the sky, the forms of our stormers were soon seen
upon the ridge of the hills; and as the enemy were
driven down, Chamberlaine’s Horse swept round amongst
them and cut them up with heavy slaughter. Rawlinson
then took the Parsewan Horse to clear the hillocks, to the
right, of the detached bodies of the enemy which still
clung to them, and Tait, with his horse, was sent to
support him. The Parsewan Horse charged gallantly;
but the ground was difficult, and the enemy fled towards
the mouth of the Baba-Wullee Pass. Rawlinson pushed
on in hot pursuit; but turning off to follow a party of the
enemy’s horse, who seemed to have missed the outlet,
well-nigh cut down or captured Mahomed Atta himself,
who was afterwards known to have been at the head of
them.</p>

<p>The rout of the enemy was complete.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> But the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of our troops were too slow to turn it to good
account. The Ghazees made for the Baba-Wullee Pass.
They had barricaded this pass with stones, and they had
thrown up a strong breast-work in another direction, intending
them as defences to lie between the British position
and their own. But now, instead of finding these
works in their front, they found them in their rear. They
had not intended that the battle should be fought so near
to the walls of Candahar. It was their design to take up
a position within these defences; but, emboldened by
the stories of the scouts, who had reported that we were
too weak to operate beyond the walls, they had determined
to pitch their camp in the vicinity of the cantonment
and to invest Candahar. Had our guns been pushed
on with sufficient activity, the enemy would have found
the barricade which they had erected for their defence a
terrible obstruction on their retreat. But the greater
number of them effected their escape; and Nott, contented
with his victory, drew off his troops.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>On the following day, Stacy went out with a brigade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and Rawlinson took the Parsewan Horse to the banks
of the river. The enemy’s horse had not wholly disappeared;
and it was believed that they might again be
drawn into another skirmish. But they were not inclined
for more fighting. As our skirmishers advanced, they fell
back and crossed the river. The chiefs held a council of
war, and the day was spent in stormy debate. But
when the shades of evening fell upon them, they had
matured no plan of operations. They broke up without a
decision. Again they met on the following day. One
plan and then another was discussed. Some proposed that
they should proceed to Caubul. Some that they should
assemble in Zemindawer. Others recommended that
they should hold their ground upon the Urghundab; but
the greater number were of opinion that it would be
more expedient to move off to the northern district, and
there await the issue of events at the capital. Many of
them sent into the British camp to ask for terms; and it
was obvious that, although the suspicion of our approaching
departure kept up considerable excitement throughout
the country, the Douranees had now arrived at the inevitable
conclusion that it was useless any longer to contend
with us in the field.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Prince Sufder Jung was waiting a
favorable opportunity to cast himself upon the mercy of
his enemies. On the day after the action of the 29th of
May, he had received a letter from his brother, Futteh
Jung, at Caubul, urging him to throw himself upon the
protection of the British; and the young Prince, weary of
the peril-laden life he had been leading, and seeing clearly
the hopelessness of the cause to which he had attached
himself, determined to follow the advice of his brother.
So, on the following day, he despatched a messenger with
a note to Rawlinson, informing him that he was on the
point of mounting his horse to ride into the British camp.
But before the British officer’s answer reached him,
Meerza Ahmed and the chiefs discovered his intentions,
and carried him off with them across the river. His
resolution, however, was not to be shaken. The chiefs
made him a close prisoner, and openly denounced him as
a traitor. But he continued to make overtures to Rawlinson,
and at last effected his escape. On the 18th of
June a letter was brought into the British camp, announcing
that he had forsaken the Douranees, and had
made a night-journey to Baba-Wullee. Rawlinson reported
the circumstance to Nott, and the General consented
to receive the submission of the boy.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> So, on the
morning of the 19th, the British political chief rode out
with a party of Parsewan Horse to the mouth of the
Baba-Wullee Pass, and, through a crowd of excited
gazers, who lined the thoroughfares from the cantonments
to the city, bought the Prince into Candahar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>No easy part was that which Rawlinson was now called
upon to play. The conflicting claims and interests of the
two Princes greatly distracted and perplexed him. Justice
and policy appeared to be at variance with each
other. Timour was a well-intentioned man; his fidelity
had never been questioned. He was the eldest son of
Shah Soojah, and his claims to the throne of Caubul were
more valid, therefore, than those of either of his brothers.
But he was utterly without influence. Convinced that
he could never make his way with the chiefs or people of
Afghanistan, the British authorities were unwilling to
support his pretensions. Even for the governorship of
Candahar they held him to be incompetent; and now
that Sufder Jung had returned to his allegiance, they
desired, on the earliest fitting opportunity, to place the
administration in his hands. The Candahar force was
under orders to return to Hindostan, and the best means
of disposing of Prince Timour was by the quiet removal
of his Highness to the British provinces. This was not
yet to be openly announced to the Prince, for it was
expedient that the measure of withdrawal should not be
publicly declared; but Rawlinson hoped, that when the
time came, he would be able to persuade Timour to
accompany the army to India, and to leave Sufder Jung
in possession of Candahar. In the meanwhile, both
Princes were uneasy and dissatisfied. Jealous of his
younger brother, Timour protested against his being permitted
to mediate for the Douranee chiefs, or to interfere
with the Candahar Government; whilst Sufder Jung was
continually complaining of the incertitude of his position,
and importuning Rawlinson to come to some definite
explanation with him.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>So Rawlinson determined to temporise. Putting off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
from day to day the adjustment of these differences, he
trusted to the chapter of accidents, and ere long found
something written down in his favour. Before the end
of June, it was announced at Candahar that Futteh
Jung had been overcome by the Barukzyes at Caubul,
and that he was in effect a mere prisoner in their hands.
The intelligence, as regarded British interests in general,
was supposed to be unfavourable; but it went far to
diminish the difficulties which the presence of the two
Princes at Candahar arrayed against the British authorities.
“Whilst Futteh Jung’s star was on the ascendant,”
wrote Rawlinson in his journal, “it was equally difficult
to manage Timour and Sufder Jung; but now they both
feel that they are entirely dependent upon us for support,
and are disposed, in consequence, to lay aside their private
jealousies.”</p>

<p>The three first weeks of July passed away; and Nott
was preparing for his retirement from Afghanistan. Major
Clarkson had, at the end of June, brought up the convoy
of camels from Quettah. The supply of carriage and provisions
for the movement of the army had now reached
its necessary amount. Everything was in train for withdrawal,
when the Governor-General’s letter of the 4th of
July was put into Nott’s hands. He saw at once the
weight of responsibility that it threw upon him; but he
did not shrink from assuming the burden. Cheerfully
taking it up, he wrote to the Governor-General on the
20th of July: “Having well considered the subject of
your Lordship’s letter of the 4th instant; having looked
at the difficulties in every point of view, and reflected on
the advantages which would attend a successful accomplishment
of such a move, and the moral influence it
would have throughout Asia, I have come to a determination
to retire a portion of the army under my command
<i>viâ</i> Ghuznee and Caubul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The Candahar force was now to be divided. A portion
of it was to be sent to Quettah and Sukkur under General
England; and the remainder, under General Nott,
was to “retire” to India by the route of Ghuznee, Caubul,
and Jellalabad. The heavy guns and six pieces of the
Shah’s artillery were to be sent down with England’s
column, and with it were to be despatched the Bombay
Infantry, two companies of Bengal Artillery, three regiments
of the late Shah’s force, and some details of Irregular
Horse. Nott would not part with one of those
“beautiful Sepoy regiments” which had fought so well
for him ever since he had commanded the Candahar
division; nor could he think of suffering the 40th Queen’s
to be disunited from their old comrades. But of the 41st
Queen’s he wrote to Lord Ellenborough: “I certainly
could have wished to have taken her Majesty’s 41st
Regiment with me, knowing the great consequence of the
adventurous march before me. But when I look to Sindh,
and to the want of confidence in our brave troops shown
by certain officers, I must give up that wish, however
desirable, to ensure the safety of the division which I am
not to accompany.” But he subsequently changed his
mind, and took the 41st with him. Two or three days
passed; some slight preparations betokening departure
were made; the old and unserviceable guns were destroyed;
the repairs, which were going on, on the works,
were arrested; and then it was publicly announced that
the force was to hold itself in readiness to return to
India. But by what route it was to retire was still a
secret. Speculation was busy throughout the garrison.
There were all sorts of rumours and conjectures, and then
it was declared that Nott’s column was to make its way
across the country by the route of Dehra Ismael Khan.
It soon, however, was obvious that this was nothing more
than a report, which might have its uses, and the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of every soldier in Nott’s division soon beat with chivalrous
emotion at the thought, that the General, under
whom they had so long and so gloriously served, was
about to lead them on to the re-conquest of Afghanistan.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>And now again came up for adjustment, rather than for
consideration, the question of the disposal of the Princes.
Timour was eager to proceed with the British force to
Caubul, and hoped to be placed upon the throne by his
old supporters. His fidelity at least deserved our support&mdash;but
something else was required to induce the British
authorities to identify themselves with the interests of the
Prince. It was fortunate for Rawlinson that at this time
the decision was not left in his hands. On the 29th of
July, letters were received from the Governor-General,
emphatically expressing his opinion of the inexpediency
of permitting the Prince to accompany the army in the
direction of Caubul, or even of permitting him to remain
at Candahar. His presence at Caubul, it was said, might
greatly embarrass our proceedings there; and though it
would be advantageous for us that he should establish his
independent authority at Candahar, there seemed so little
likelihood of his being able to maintain his position after
the departure of the British troops, that, on the whole, it
was the most expedient course that he should accompany
that portion of the force which was to proceed by the way
of Sindh to the provinces of India. The communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of these resolutions to the Shaz-zadah was a painful duty;
and when Rawlinson announced them, they produced
an explosion very foreign to the passive nature of the
apathetic Prince.</p>

<p>On the 7th of August, the British force evacuated
Candahar. There were no demonstrations of ill-will on
the part of the inhabitants. No acts of licentiousness
were committed by the soldiery. The movement was
effected in the most orderly and peaceable manner. The
soldiers and the citizens were seen embracing each other.
Before night closed upon the scene, Prince Timour moved
out of the citadel, and Sufder Jung remained in possession
of Candahar.</p>

<p>On the following day, completing their Commissariat
arrangements, Nott and England remained in camp under
the city walls. Many of the most influential people of
the new government waited upon Rawlinson, seeking his
advice. On the 9th, Nott commenced his march to the
northward, and England prepared to move in the opposite
direction. The latter was dissatisfied with the components
of his force. He applied to Nott for an European
regiment to accompany him, and received in reply an
indignant rebuke.</p>

<p>From Candahar to Mookoor the progress of Nott’s
division was easy and uneventful. But few traces of the
recent excitement were discernible along the line of march.
The villages seemed wonderfully tranquil. The villagers
brought in their supplies more freely than our officers had
ever ventured to expect. Every precaution was taken
by the General to prevent the commission by his troops
of acts of lawless depredation. He declared, that if any
soldier were caught in the act of plundering, or returning
with plunder in his possession, he would hang the offender,
and remove the officer to whose regiment he might belong
from the command of his corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 27th of August, the force arrived at Mookoor.
Up to this point&mdash;a distance of 160 miles&mdash;not a shot
had been fired. But there were symptoms now of more
active work for our troops. Some days before their
arrival at Mookoor, Shumshoodeen Khan had moved
out of Ghuznee with a party of 500 horse and two guns,
to collect revenue in the adjacent country. He was
ignorant, at the time, of our advance; but when the
tidings reached him, he prepared at once to contest the
progress of the British force; threw all his energies into
the work of raising the country between Ghuznee and
Mookoor; and made arrangements “for all the chiefs to
rendezvous at the latter place, and fight us at the source
of the Turnuck.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>But the British force approached Mookoor; and Shumshoodeen
Khan was not ready to receive them. The chiefs
had not come to the rendezvous. His preparations were
not completed. He had fallen back to the vicinity of
Oba, and there the chiefs were flocking to his standard.
But, as Nott advanced that sultry morning through a thick
haze upon Mookoor, it was plain to him that he was in an
enemy’s country. The villages were deserted. Supplies
were not brought into his camp. He was compelled to
send his cavalry out to forage. It was plain, too, that
the enemy had wisely chosen the ground on which they
had determined to give us battle. There was no more
defensible position on the whole line of country from
Candahar to Caubul than that at the source of the
Turnuck, which Shumshoodeen Khan had selected as his
point of defence.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was an eventful one. On the morning
of the 28th of August the force advanced from Mookoor.
The rear-guard had scarcely moved from their encamping-ground
when the enemy came down upon them. Nott
ordered out his irregular cavalry, under Captain Christie,
who cut up some fifty of the enemy’s footmen; and, but
for an interposing ravine, would have destroyed the whole.
Without further molestation the force reached its halting-ground
and encamped. It was known that Shumshoodeen
was somewhere in the neighbourhood; but through the
thick haze which enveloped the camp, it was impossible to
determine his position. The camels went out to graze.
The grass-cutters went out to obtain forage for their
horses. Everything was going on in camp after the
wonted fashion, when, an hour before noon, a report came
in that Delamain’s grass-cutters were being cut to pieces
by the enemy. Delamain waited for no orders&mdash;never
paused to inquire into the truth of the story that was
brought to him&mdash;but at once ordered his troopers into
their saddles, and rode out, with all the disposable cavalry,
in search of an imaginary foe.</p>

<p>He soon found that it was a false alarm. His grass-cutters
were not in the hands of the enemy. But he
went on to reconnoitre, and about three miles from camp
came up with a party of the enemy’s footmen on the
plain. Some twenty of them were cut down by our
troopers, and the remainder put to confusion and flight.
Delamain went after them in hot pursuit, and coming to
the foot of a range of hills, turned the shoulder of one of
them, and found that the heights were crowned, in considerable
strength, by the enemy’s jezailchees, who opened
upon him a galling fire. He was falling back, in orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
retreat, when a body of the enemy’s Horse, about 150
strong, showed themselves on the ridge of a hill, flaunting
a white standard. Delamain at once determined to attack
them. A squadron of the 3rd Bombay Cavalry charged
up the hill; but a hot fire from a party of jezailchees,
who suddenly appeared on their flanks, saluted them as
they advanced; and then the enemy’s Horse poured down
upon them with tremendous effect. Captain Reeves was
shot near the foot of the hill. Captain Bury and Lieutenant
Mackenzie gained the ridge; but fell beneath the
sabres of the Afghan horsemen. The troopers now seeing
their officers fall, borne down by the weight of the Afghan
Horse, and suffering severely from the fire of the jezailchees,
turned and fled down the hill. Their companions
at the foot of the hill caught the contagion from them.
The panic spread, and the whole body of British Horse
were soon in disastrous flight. Riding each other down
in wild confusion, they were not easily reduced to order.
The loss among them had been severe. Two officers were
killed, and three wounded; and fifty-six of our men had
been killed or disabled in the fight.</p>

<p>In the mean while, exaggerated stories of the disaster
had spread throughout Nott’s camp. Messenger after
messenger had come to the General, and reported that
the enemy were in immense force, and that Delamain and
his cavalry had been annihilated.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Twice he sent out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
instructions for the troops to return to camp. At last it
was reported to him that the enemy were 7000 strong,
and that Delamain, if not already destroyed, was in
imminent peril. So Nott took out his army and moved
against the enemy&mdash;expecting to find them flushed with
success and eager for a general action. But when they
came upon the ground, it was found that the enemy had
moved off. Their videttes alone were to be seen on the
peaks of the hills.</p>

<p>But there was still work to be done. From some
fortified villages in the neighbourhood of the field of
action it was said that shots had been fired. The General
marched upon them. In an attitude of abject submission
the villagers came out and prayed for quarter. Nott
granted the boon. But a company of the 40th Queen’s
was sent in to search the houses, where it was believed
some plunder would be found. From the matchlocks of
some Ghazees shots were fired as our soldiers entered the
place. The result of the misdeed was terrible. The
place was given up to carnage. The women and children
were spared; but the men were indiscriminately
butchered.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Not less than a hundred of the villagers
were massacred for the offences of a few men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the General was thus employed, the cavalry,
which had sustained so mortifying a defeat, were endeavouring,
with the aid of the horse artillery and some
infantry details, to rescue the bodies of their dead. The
corpses were brought off; and then the entire force
returned to camp. That evening the two European
officers<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> received Christian burial. The wounded officers
recovered.</p>

<p>“This was a bad beginning,” wrote Rawlinson to
Outram, “but we have amply redeemed it since.” On
the 30th of August the Candahar division was again
engaged with the enemy; and with better success. On
the preceding day, Shumshoodeen Khan had sent round
the heads of the officers who had fallen in the action of
the 28th,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and, greatly exaggerating the victory he had
gained, endeavoured to raise the people against the
infidels whom he had beaten so gloriously in the field.
On that day considerable reinforcements joined him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
He was seen on the hills to the right of Nott’s camp,
with four or five thousand men, and it was believed that
he would attack our troops in the course of the morrow’s
march. The morrow came. Nott marched to Ghoaine.
Shumshoodeen Khan moved parallel to him, and took up
his position again on the hills to the right of the British
camp. As every hour was increasing his numbers, he
desired to postpone the inevitable collision. On the
afternoon of the 30th he is said to have mustered not less
than 10,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Not far from the ground on which Nott halted on that
morning, was a fort held by the enemy which he determined
to attack. But the day was sultry. The troops
were exhausted by their march. So the General pitched
his camp at once, and giving his troops a few hours to
recruit and refresh themselves, postponed the attack to
the afternoon. At three o’clock the General went out with
the 40th Queen’s, the 16th and 38th Native Infantry
Regiments, all his cavalry details, Anderson’s troop of
Horse Artillery, two guns of Blood’s battery, and two
eighteen-pounders. The ground between our camp and
the fort was difficult. Some time elapsed before the guns
could be brought up to breaching distance. And, when
at last they opened upon the fort, they made so little
impression, that Shumshoodeen was persuaded by his
chiefs not to shrink any longer from a general action with
a force whose cavalry had been already beaten in the
field, and whose artillery now seemed so little formidable.
So, scattering his horsemen on both sides so as to outflank
us, Shumshoodeen moved down with the main body of
his infantry and his guns; and, planting the latter on
the nearest height, opened a rapid and well-directed fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
on the British columns.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Then Nott drew off his troops
from the attack of the fort, and advanced in column to
the right, flanked by Anderson’s guns and Christie’s
Horse, upon the main body of Shumshoodeen’s fighting
men. On this the enemy crowded upon the other flank,
keeping up a smart fire both from their guns and jezails;
so Nott “changed front to the left, deployed, threw out
skirmishers, and advanced in line, supported by the
guns.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> For some time, the enemy seemed inclined to
engage us, and kept up a sharp fire from their guns and
jezails; but when our troops came to the charge, and
pushed on with a loud and cheerful hurrah, the Afghans
turned and fled before us. One of their guns broke down
and was immediately captured. Christie, with his Horse,
went off in pursuit of the other, sabred the drivers, and
carried off the piece. Shumshoodeen’s tents, magazines,
and stores were found scattered about the plain. The
chief himself fled to Ghuznee; and the tribes who had
joined his standard now dispersed to their homes.</p>

<p>Nott halted upon his ground during the following day,
and on the 1st of September resumed his march. On the
5th, he was before Ghuznee. The day was spent in desultory
fighting. Shumshoodeen, who had been reinforced
from Caubul by Sultan Jan, occupied with a strong body
of horse and foot some heights to the north-east of the
fortress. The gay attire and fine chargers of the chiefs
made them conspicuous even at a distance.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The gardens,
the ravines, and water-courses were filled with jezailchees;
and the city seemed to be swarming with men. Before
encamping his force, Nott determined to clear the heights;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and gallantly the work was done. Our troops ascended
in noble style, and drove the enemy before them until
every point was gained.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In the mean time the camp
had been pitched. Two infantry regiments and two guns
were left out to occupy the heights, and the remainder of
the troops were then withdrawn.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had the troops entered their camp,
when the great Ghuznee gun, the “Zubbur Jung,” began
to open upon it. It was plain that Nott had taken up a
position too near to the enemy’s works. Fourteen shots
were thrown into our camp without doing any mischief;
but the warning was not thrown away. The tents were
struck, and the camp was moved to another position,
in the vicinity of the village of Roza.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The movement
was not without danger;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> but the enemy wanted spirit to
turn it to good account&mdash;and in their new position our
troops were secure.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Before sunset the firing had ceased. Sanders, the
engineer, a man of rare talent, now began to make his
arrangements for the siege of Ghuznee. It was not
believed that the defence would be conducted with much
vigour. The fort was very poorly manned. It was
obvious that Shumshoodeen had trusted more to external
operations. The tribes who had been summoned for the
defence of the city had already begun to lose heart.
When they saw our engineers at work busily constructing
their batteries, they called upon Shumshoodeen to
come within the walls, and take his share of the dangers
of the siege. Vainly he represented that his cavalry were
of greater service beyond the walls&mdash;vainly he set forth
that as there was no barley in the city his horses could
not be fed. They had made up their minds to evacuate
the place; and when night closed in upon them, they
moved out quietly by the water-gate of the city, and
betook themselves to the hills. Seeing now that all was
over, Shumshoodeen mounted his horse, and with a small
party of followers fled to Caubul.</p>

<p>The engineers worked busily throughout the night;
but as the batteries took shape under their hands, the
stillness within the walls of Ghuznee aroused their suspicions.
So at early dawn, with a party of some twenty
men, North, the engineer, went down to reconnoitre;
and finding the water-gate open, and the city apparently
abandoned, sent intelligence to the party on the hill, and
the 16th Regiment, which had remained out to protect
the working parties, was marched down to occupy the
place. They found it almost deserted. A few Hindoos
and some Sepoys of the unfortunate 27th Regiment were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the only occupants of Ghuznee.[A] And when, at early
dawn, the officers of Nott’s camp looked through their
telescopes towards the citadel, they plainly saw our
Sepoys on the ramparts. Soon the British flag was
waving from the highest tower, and Shumshoodeen’s artillery,
worked by his enemies, was roaring out a royal
salute in honour of their triumph. The General and his
staff rode out from camp to inspect the place, and to
make arrangements for its destruction. They found the
city a mass of ruins; and in the houses which had been
occupied by the officers of Palmer’s garrison, many sorrowful
mementoes of the sufferings they had endured,
written or scratched on the walls. The citadel was in
good repair, and every one who inspected it marvelled how
it happened that Palmer had yielded it up, and trusted
himself and his men to the honour of his treacherous
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>And now began the work of destruction. The artillery
officers burst the enemy’s guns, and the engineers
ran mines and exploded them, under different parts of
the works. After this the town and citadel were fired.
The wood-work soon ignited, and all through the night
the flames of the burning fortress lit up the over-hanging
sky.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>But there was something else now to be done. At the
village of Roza, in the vicinity of Ghuznee, is the tomb of
Sultan Mahmoud. A peculiar odour of sanctity is
exhaled from that shrine. The priests, in whose guardianship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
it is held, have their traditions concerning it, in which
the spurious greatly prevails. Its boasted antiquity is not
supported by any credible evidence; and when Major
Rawlinson carried to the examination of the inscriptions
on the tomb all that profound knowledge and acute penetration
which have since attained for him, in the Eastern
and in the Western world, so wide a celebrity as the
first of Oriental antiquaries, he had at once detected unmistakeable
proofs of their belonging to a more recent
period than the Moollahs had claimed for them.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the shrine was a venerable one, and by the priesthood
of Afghanistan held in no common esteem. The famous
sandal-wood gates of Somnauth, which Mahmoud had
carried off from their home in Guzerat, were deposited at
the conqueror’s tomb. Such at least had long been
the popular faith; and among the priesthood and the
people of Afghanistan, no one doubted that the trophies
were genuine. It was reserved for European scepticism
to cast discredit upon the reality of the sacred relics.</p>

<p>But, whether genuine or spurious, upon these gates
Lord Ellenborough had fixed his desires. What he knew
about them, where he had read of them, or by whom his
attention was drawn to them, History cannot determine.
It is sufficient that on the 4th of July, when the Governor-General
wrote to General Nott, authorising him to “retire”
to the provinces of India, by the route of Ghuznee, Caubul,
and Jellalabad, he inserted in this memorable letter a
paragraph instructing the General to despoil the tomb of
Sultan Mahmoud. “You will bring away,” he wrote,
“from the tomb of Mahmoud of Ghuznee, his club, which
hangs over it, and you will bring away the gates of
his tomb, which are the gates of the Temple of Somnauth.”
So, on the 8th of September, under Sanders’s
superintendence, the gates of Mahmoud’s tomb were
carried off, as tenderly as they could perform the
duty, by a party of English soldiers. The Moollahs
wept bitterly. But the shrine was not otherwise profaned;
and the excitement which the spoliation created
scarcely extended beyond the holy circle of the priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Onward went Nott with his trophies. On the 12th he
was before Sydeabad, where Woodburn and his men had
been decoyed and massacred. This fort was at once
destroyed; and another was fired by the camp-followers.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
On the following day the enemy crowned the hills on both
flanks; but not until the 14th did they appear in sufficient
numbers, or assume such an attitude, as to bring on
a collision with our advancing troops. On that day, near
Mydan, Nott attacked them on the heights. It seemed
that Shumshoodeen and Sultan Jan had determined to
make a last stand for the defence of the capital; but
having hitherto gained so little advantage by meeting us in
the open country, had resolved to try the effect of opposing
us at the gorge of the hills stretching towards Mydan.
Here they had thrown up breastworks. Nott, however,
precipitated the engagement, and carried the contest
to the heights.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> All arms were now engaged. The day
was a busy one. It was one of doubtful victory on either
side. The heights were carried; but they were not held.
And when night fell upon the contending hosts, and the
moon again lit up the scene, it seemed that the work was
not yet done. A busy night was looked for as the sequel
of a busy day. But suddenly the exertions of the
enemy slackened. News of the defeat of Akbar Khan
at Tezeen had reached the camp of the chiefs. They
seemed to have changed their tactics, and to have moved
off to Urghundeh&mdash;a place a few miles nearer to the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The position which Shumshoodeen had intended to take
up, at the gorge of the Mydan Pass, was found, when Nott
advanced on the following day, to have been abandoned.
But the day was a busy one. The tribes were up along
the line of march and harassed us severely with their
jezails. The breaking down of one of our guns crippled
our movements and gave some temporary advantage to the
enemy. All arms of our force distinguished themselves.
The practice of the guns was excellent. The infantry
clomb the heights with their wonted gallantry; and the
cavalry did good service. The result was all that could
be wished, and to the Afghans the day was a disastrous
one. The Mydanees, who had been actively engaged in
the Caubul insurrection, and some of whom had now accompanied
Sultan Jan in his march to the southward, and had
been engaged, under his standard, with the British troops
at Ghuznee, now sent a deputation to the General claiming
his protection. Nott dismissed them with an indignant
rebuke. Little protection was there in store for them.
The Sepoys and camp-followers began to fire their forts,
and at sunset six-and-twenty of them might have been
counted lighting up the evening sky.</p>

<p>The march was now nearly at an end. Passing Urghundeh
on the 16th of September&mdash;the place where, in
the autumn of 1839, Dost Mahomed had planted his guns,
and determined to make a last stand against Sir John
Keane’s advancing army&mdash;Nott’s division neared Caubul.
On the 17th, it had encamped at a distance of some four
or five miles from the city. But the Jellalabad army had
anticipated its arrival. Caubul was already in possession
of the British. Pollock had planted the British ensign
upon the heights of the Balla Hissar.</p>

plain now that there was no enemy to be encountered at
the capital. Akbar Khan had fled to Ghorebund, ready,
if need be, to take flight across the Hindoo-Koosh. The
other hostile chiefs were supposed to be in the Kohistan.
Everything at Caubul betokened the panic engendered by
the approach of our retributory arms.</p>

<p>On the day after his arrival, Pollock prepared formally
to take possession of the Balla Hissar. A detachment of
horse and foot, with a troop of horse artillery, was
told off, to give effect to the ceremony. The British
flag was to be hoisted on the highest point of the
citadel, and the British guns were to roar forth a royal
salute in honour of the re-occupation of the capital of
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>All this was done&mdash;but, on that September morning,
there occurred coincidentally with it another event much
controverted and much misunderstood. The wretched
Prince Futteh Jung, who, two weeks before, had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
his tattered clothes and his bewildered brain to General
Pollock’s camp at Gundamuck, had now returned under
the General’s protection, to start again as a candidate for
the throne from which he had been driven by the
Barukzye Sirdar. It was not the policy of the British
Government openly to interfere for the establishment of
any government in Afghanistan, or to identify itself with
any particular party or Prince. But both Pollock and
Macgregor were of opinion, that so long as the British
were to remain at Caubul, it would be desirable that
a government of some kind should be established, if only
to enable our armies more surely to obtain their supplies.
Some sort of indirect assistance and protection was therefore
extended to the Prince. The friendly chiefs were
encouraged to give in their allegiance to him; and he
was suffered to turn to his own uses the ceremony of
the re-occupation of the Balla Hissar. He asked and
obtained permission to accompany the British detachment;
because, he said, treachery was to be apprehended, if he
proceeded to the palace without the support of his father’s
allies.</p>

<p>And so it happened, that when the British detachment
moved from its ground towards the Balla Hissar, the
Prince, attended by some of his principal adherents, fell
in at the head of the procession. A portion of the town
was traversed by the detachment on its way to the citadel.
But, although the hideous sights of the last few days were
still fresh in the memory of the troops, they resisted all
temptation to violence and outrage. Not a man was
hurt, or a house injured. In orderly procession they
streamed into the citadel. The road to the point at which
the colours were to be hoisted ran by the palace gates.
As a road for the passage of artillery, indeed, it terminated
there. It was necessary that the General should halt the
guns and troops in the vicinity of the palace. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
no point beyond, to which they could proceed. The
Prince and his attendants entered the royal abode; and
the British General, with some of his principal officers,
were invited to appear at his installation. Pollock sate on
a chair on the right of the throne, and M’Caskill on the
left. Then was gone through the ceremony of appointing
officers of state; and the British allies of the new King
took their departure, and went about their own work.
The General and his Staff moved forward with the British
colours, and planted them on the highest conspicuous
point of the Balla Hissar. As the colours were raised
the troops presented arms, the guns broke out into a
royal salute, the band struck up the National Anthem,
and three hearty cheers went up to announce that the
vindication of our national honour was complete.</p>

<p>So far was the restoration of Futteh Jung to the
throne of his fathers encouraged and aided by the British
General. The Prince had been suffered to hang on to
the skirts of Circumstance, and to make the most of a
favourable coincidence. But so careful was Pollock not
to encourage in the breast of the Shah-zadah and his
adherents any hope of more direct assistance from the
British Government, that Macgregor was deputed to wait
on Futteh Jung after the Durbar, and to enter into a
definite explanation of our views. He was emphatically
told that he was to look for no assistance, in men, money,
or arms, from the British Government; and that therefore
it behoved him to turn his own resources to the best
account.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> He was instructed, too, that the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
authorities were unwilling to interfere in any way in the
administration, and that it was necessary that he should
immediately proceed unbiassed to the election of a
minister. The choice lay between the Nizam-ood-dowlah
and Gholam Mahomed Khan, Populzye. On the evening
of the 18th a council was held, and the decision of the
Prince and the chiefs was eventually in favour of the
latter.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Pollock’s mind was heavy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
thoughts of the probable fate of the British prisoners.
They had been carried off towards the regions of the
Hindoo-Koosh, and were, perhaps, even now on the way
to hopeless slavery in Toorkistan. Immediately on his
arrival at Caubul, the General had despatched his military
secretary, Sir Richmond Shakespear, with a party of 600
Kuzzilbash Horse,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> to overtake the prisoners and their
escort. But there was a possibility of this party being
intercepted by the enemy. It was said that Sultan Jan
was hovering about with some such mischievous intent.
At all events, it was expedient to send a strong detachment
of British troops to the support of Shakespear and
his Kuzzilbashes. The service was one which any officer
might have been proud to undertake. Pollock offered the
honour of the undertaking to Nott and the Candahar
division. But the offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>The two divisions of the British army were on opposite
sides of Caubul. The first communication that had
taken place between them was accomplished through the
agency of Major Rawlinson. He had ridden in Afghan
costume from Nott’s camp at Urghundeh, and had joined
Pollock’s division on the morning of the 16th of September,
shortly after the British colours had been planted on
the Balla Hissar. On the following day Rawlinson returned
to Nott’s camp. Mayne, who had done such good
service at Jellalabad, and who was now attached to
Pollock’s staff, rode with him, attended by a party of
Irregular Horse. They bore a note from Pollock, suggesting
that a brigade from the Candahar division should
be detached towards Bameean, to assist the recovery of
the prisoners. The Candahar force were pitching their
camp at Char-Deh, when Rawlinson and Mayne reached
them. Nott received the letter of his brother-general in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
no very genial mood. He had already made up his mind
on the subject. Twice before had the officers of his own
force suggested to General Nott that the recovery of the
prisoners would be facilitated by the despatch of a detachment
from his division.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> But he had always answered,
that he believed the recovery of the prisoners to be a
matter of indifference to Government, and that he did not
consider it expedient to divide his force.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the proposal came to him in a more
official shape from his brother-general&mdash;upon whom, as
the senior officer, had now devolved the command of all
the troops in Afghanistan&mdash;he received it as one on which
he had no consideration to bestow, and determined at
once, within the bounds of due subordination, to decline
it. It would be well if there were nothing else to record.
Unhappily, the temper of the Candahar General was such,
that the officer&mdash;one of the bravest and, for his years, the
most distinguished in Afghanistan&mdash;who presented himself
in Nott’s camp, to bring back the General’s answer,
met with a welcome which may little have surprised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
however much it may have pained, the officers of Nott’s
Staff, but which, upon one accustomed, in Sale’s and
Pollock’s camps, to the courtesies due to a soldier and a
gentleman, burst like a loaded shell. Chafing under the
thought of being recommended by his superior to do what
his own better judgment suggested to him that he ought
to have done unprompted, the Candahar General poured
upon Mayne and his escort all the vials of his wrath.
What he said was heard by many, and is upon record.
Mayne, stung by the insult put upon him by the veteran
commander, refused to continue in his camp, and said he
would await at the outlying picket the answer which he
was commissioned to carry back to Pollock’s tent.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>But when Nott entered his tent, and sat down to
write a reply to his brother-general, he did not wholly
forget the duties of a soldier to his superior in rank. He
stated, in emphatic language, his reasons for protesting
against the adoption of the course suggested to him; but
at the same time declared his willingness to obey the
orders of his superior officer. What these reasons were
must be set forth in his own words:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1">Camp, September 17th, 1842.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I have been favoured with your note of this date, in which
you express a wish that I should detach a brigade towards Bameean;
before you decide on sending it, I would beg to state as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The troops under my command have just made a long and
very difficult march of upwards of 300 miles, and they have been
continually marching about for the last six months, and most
certainly require rest for a day or two&mdash;the same with my camels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and other cattle. I lost twenty-nine camels yesterday, and expect
to-day’s report will be double that number.</p>

<p>2nd. I am getting short of supplies for Europeans and natives,
and I can see but little probability of getting a quantity equal to
my daily consumption at this place. I have little or no money.</p>

<p>3rd. I have so many sick and wounded that I fear I shall have
the greatest inconvenience and difficulty in carrying them; and
should any unnecessary operations add to their number, they must
be left to perish. If I remain here many days I shall expect to lose
half my cattle, which will render retirement very difficult.</p>

<p>4th. I sincerely think that sending a small detachment will and
must be followed by deep disaster. No doubt Mahomed Akbar,
Shumshoodeen, and the other chiefs, are uniting their forces, and I
hourly expect to hear that Sir R. Shakespear is added to the
number of British prisoners. In my last affair with Shumshoodeen
and Sultan Jan, they had 12,000 men; and my information is that
two days ago they set out for Bameean.</p>

<p>5th. After much experience in this country, my opinion is that,
if the system of sending out detachments should be adopted,
disaster and ruin will follow.</p>

<p>6th. After bringing to your notice, showing that my men require
rest for a day or two, that my camels are dying fast, and that my
supplies are nearly expended, should you order my force to be
divided, I have nothing to do but implicitly to obey your orders;
but, my dear General, I feel assured you will excuse me when I
most respectfully venture to protest against it under the circumstances
above noted. I could have wished to have stated this in
person to you, but I have been so very unwell for the last two
months that I am sure you will kindly excuse me.</p>

<p class="pr6">
Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Wm. Nott.</span><a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">On the following day, Nott having excused himself on
the plea of ill health from visiting Pollock in his camp,
Pollock, waiving the distinction of his superior rank, called
upon his brother-general. The conversation which ensued
related mainly to the question of the despatch of the
brigade in aid of the recovery of the British prisoners.
Nott had made up his mind on the subject. He was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
to be moved from his first position. There were few besides
himself who considered the arguments which he
advanced to be of the overwhelming and conclusive character
which Nott himself believed them to be; and it
was, at all events, sufficiently clear, that as it was of
primal importance on such a service to lose the least possible
amount of time, it was desirable to detach a brigade
from Nott’s camp, in preference to one from Pollock’s, if
only because the former was some ten miles nearer to
Bameean than the latter. Nott was inflexible. Government,
he said, “had thrown the prisoners overboard”&mdash;why
then should he rescue them? He would obey the
orders of his superior officer, but only under protest. So
Pollock returned to camp, and delegated to another officer
the honourable service which Nott had emphatically declined.
Sir Robert Sale was not likely to decline it.
Though his own heroic wife had not been one of the captives,
every feeling of the soldier and the man would
have responded to the appeal.</p>

<p>So Sale took out with him a brigade from the Jellalabad
army, and pushed on in pursuit of Shakespear and the
Kuzzilbashes. But already had the release of the prisoners
been effected. They had accomplished their own liberation.
Sale met them with Shakespear and the Kuzzilbash
escort on their way to Pollock’s camp.</p>

<p>The story which they had to tell was this. On the
afternoon of the 25th of August the prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> who had
already received a general intimation that they were to
be carried off to Bameean, but who had still ventured to
hope that some efforts might be made by the chiefs in our
interests to release them, were warned by Captain Troup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
who had just returned from an interview with the Sirdar,
to prepare for the journey towards the Hindoo-Koosh.
Soon after sunset a guard of three hundred men arrived
to escort them. Their ponies, camels, and litters were
brought, and an hour or two before midnight they started
upon their dreary journey.</p>

<p>They were not suffered to sleep that night, nor the
next; but were painfully hurried on towards the inhospitable
regions of the Indian Caucasus. All the forts and
villages by which they passed poured forth their inhabitants
to stare, with wondering curiosity, at the Feringhee
captives.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> But none insulted them in their misfortunes.
Often, indeed, by the rude inhabitants of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
through which they passed, were many looks, and words,
and deeds of kindness freely bestowed upon them. Onwards
still, in upward direction, they went, thousands of
feet above the level of the sea. The days were painfully
sultry, and the nights were bitterly cold. The alternations
of climate told fearfully upon the constitutions of
the European prisoners; and their sick increased in
numbers. The soldiers and camp-followers, for whom no
carriage was provided, dragged their infirm limbs wearily
over the barren wastes and up the steep ascents of the
Hindoo-Koosh, the officers giving up their horses to the
ladies, for whom the camel panniers were no longer secure,
toiled wearily after them up the rugged slopes.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of September they reached Bameean. Conducted
to one wretched fort and then to another, they
remonstrated against the noisome quarters to which it
was proposed to consign them; and twice their importunities
prevailed. But at last, on the 9th of September,
the commandant of their escort ordered them to take up
their abode in another fort, scarcely less wretched than
the others, and portioned out among them some small and
comfortless apartments, so dark that they could scarcely
see in them, and so filthy that they could write their names
in the soot that covered the roof. But their residence in
this place was but brief. They soon effected their escape.</p>

<p>The commander of the escort was one Saleh Mahomed.
A soldier of fortune, who had visited many countries and
served under many masters, he had been at one time a
soubahdar in Captain Hopkins’s regiment of infantry, and
had deserted with his men to Dost Mahomed on the eve
of the contest at Bameean. A good-humoured, loquacious,
boasting man, he was never happier than when
narrating his adventures to the English officers under his
charge. Among them there was not one who better
understood the Afghan character, or who had made more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
friends in the country, than Captain Johnson; and now,
in a short time, between him and Saleh Mahomed an
intimacy was established, which the former began to turn
to the best account.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> He rode with the commandant,
listened to his stories; and soon began to throw out hints
that a lakh of rupees and a pension in Hindostan might
be found for him, if, instead of carrying off his prisoners
to Bameean, he would conduct them in safety to the
British camp. To Pottinger, who had hitherto been the
chief negotiator on the part of the captives, Johnson
would now have confided the delicate duty of inducing
the deserter again to desert; but the task was declined,
on the plea that the attempt was more likely to succeed
in the hands of the latter, who seemed to have inspired a
feeling of friendship in the breast of the commandant.
Pottinger disliked the man; and the man seemed to
dislike him. So Johnson began, with admirable tact and
address, to work upon the cupidity of his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th of August, the suggestion was put forth,
in a light and jesting manner; and not until he had convinced
himself that there would be no danger in a more
direct proposition, did Johnson suffer Saleh Mahomed to
feel that he was thoroughly in earnest. The Afghan was
in no hurry to commit himself. Days passed. The party
reached Bameean; and no allusion was made to the
subject; till one day&mdash;the 11th of September&mdash;Saleh
Mahomed sent for Johnson, Pottinger, and Lawrence, and
in a private room of the fort, which had been appropriated
to Lady Sale, produced a letter which he had just received
from Akbar Khan. The Sirdar had instructed him to
convey the prisoners to Kooloom, and to make them all
over to the Wullee of that place. It seemed then that
they were about to end their days in hopeless captivity
among the Oosbegs. But the despair which fell upon
them was but short-lived. Saleh Mahomed soon dispersed
their fears by saying that one Syud Moorteza Shah, a
Cashmeree, who, during the Caubul insurrection, had
helped Johnson to collect grain from the villages, had
arrived from Caubul, and brought a message from Mohun
Lai to the effect, that if he would release the prisoners,
General Pollock would ensure him a life-pension of 1000
rupees a month, and make him a present of 20,000 rupees.
“I know nothing of General Pollock,” then said Saleh
Mahomed, “but if you three gentlemen will swear by
your Saviour to make good to me what Syud Moorteza
Shah states that he is authorised to offer, I will deliver
you over to your own people.” The offer was at once
accepted. With little delay an agreement was written
out in Persian by Syud Moorteeza Shah, and signed by
Johnson, Pottinger, Lawrence, and Mackenzie.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
perilous game&mdash;for Saleh Mahomed had twice played the
traitor before, and might assume the same character
again. But the prize was too great and too tempting
for them to hesitate even to risk their lives; so they
flung themselves without hesitation into the hazardous
plot.</p>

<p>Cheerfully did the prisoners now bind themselves to
provide from their own resources, all according to their
means, the money that was required to carry out the
grand object of their liberation. The signatures of all
the officers and ladies were obtained to the bond.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Saleh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Mahomed proved to be staunch and true. The conspiracy
was wholly successful; and the conspirators soon
grew bold in their success. The rebellion of Saleh Mahomed
and his European allies was openly proclaimed to all
the chiefs and people of Bameean and the surrounding
country. A flag was hoisted on the fort which they occupied.
They deposed the governor of the place, and appointed
a more friendly chief in his stead. They levied
contributions upon a party of Lohanee merchants, who
were passing that way; and so supplied themselves with
funds. And, to crown all, Major Pottinger began to issue
proclamations, calling upon all the neighbouring chiefs to
come in and make their salaam; he granted remissions of
revenue; and all the decent clothes in the possession of
the party were collected to bestow as <i>Khelats</i>.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the boldness of their outward bearing
at this time, they were not without some apprehensions
that their dominion might soon be broken down, and
the lords of to-day reduced again to captives and slaves
to-morrow. Some of the confederate chiefs might ere long
appear at Bameean and overwhelm the rebellion of Saleh
Mahomed. So the new rulers began to strengthen their
position, and make preparations to stand a siege. They
had promised their guards&mdash;in all some 250 men&mdash;four
months’ pay, as a gratuity, on reaching Caubul; and there
was every reason to rely on their fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Commanded
by European officers, it was believed that they would
make a good show of resistance. So Pottinger and his
companions began to clear out the loopholes of the forts&mdash;to
dig wells&mdash;to lay in provisions&mdash;and otherwise to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
against the probability of a siege. They were busily
employed in this manner on the 15th of September, when
a horseman was observed approaching from the Caubul side
of the valley. Eager for intelligence from the capital,
they left their work and gathered round him. He brought
glad tidings. Akbar Khan had been defeated by General
Pollock at Tezeen, and had fled no one knew whither.
The aspect of affairs was now changed, indeed. The common
voice of the prisoners&mdash;prisoners no longer&mdash;declared
in favour of an immediate return to Caubul. It was
decided that, on the following morning, they should set
out for Pollock’s camp.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock on the morning of the 16th they started
on their journey. Sleeping that night, in the clear moonlight,
on hard stony beds, they were awakened by the
arrival of a friendly chief who brought a letter from Sir
Richmond Shakespear, stating that he was on his way to
Bameean, with a party of 600 Kuzzilbash horse. This
was cheering intelligence. At daybreak they were again
astir, pushing on with increased rapidity, in a whirl of
excitement, unconscious of hunger or fatigue. Their trials
were now nearly at an end. They had heart enough to do
and to suffer anything.</p>

<p>About three hours after noon on the 17th of September,
a cloud of dust was observed to rise from the
summit of a mountain-pass in their front. Presently a
few straggling horsemen made their appearance, and, in
a little time, the English officers could plainly see a
body of cavalry winding down the pass. Great now
was the excitement in our little party. The horsemen
who were now approaching might be Shakespear and
the Kuzzilbashes, or they might be a body of the enemy.
It was well at least to prepare for their reception. Saleh
Mahomed’s drums were beaten; all stragglers were
called in; every man stood to his arms; a line was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
formed;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> the muskets were loaded; and Saleh Mahomed
seemed all eagerness to give the enemy a warm
reception. But there was no enemy to be defeated. An
English officer soon appeared galloping a-head of the
horsemen. Shakespear had arrived with his Kuzzilbashes.
He was soon in the midst of the prisoners,
offering them his congratulations, receiving their thanks,
and endeavouring to answer their thick-coming questions.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the following morning they pushed
on again. Some better horses had been obtained from
the Kuzzilbashes; and now they moved forward with
increasing rapidity. On the 20th, as two or three of the
officers riding on a-head of the party were nearing Urghundeh,
which was to be their halting-place, another
cloud of dust was observed rising over the hills; and soon
the welcome tidings reached them that a large body
of British cavalry and infantry was approaching. This
was the column which Pollock had sent out in support
of the Kuzzilbash Horse&mdash;the column that Sale commanded.
In a little time the happy veteran had embraced
his wife and daughter; and the men of the 13th
had offered their delighted congratulations to the loved
ones of their old commander. A royal salute was fired.
The prisoners were safe in Sale’s camp. Their anxieties
were at an end. The good Providence that had so long
watched over the prisoner and the captive now crowned
its mercies by delivering them into the hands of their
friends. Dressed as they were in Afghan costume, their
faces bronzed by much exposure, and rugged with beards
and moustachios of many months’ growth, it was not easy
to recognise the liberated officers who now pushed forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
to receive the congratulations of their friends. On
that day they skirted the ground on which the Candahar
force was posted, and out went officers, and soldiers, and
camp-followers, eager and curious, to gaze at the released
captives, and half-inclined to fall upon their guards.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> On
the 21st of September they passed through the city, on
their way to Pollock’s camp. They found the shops closed;
the streets deserted; and they paused, as they went along,
before some melancholy memorials of the great outbreak
which, a year before, had overwhelmed us with misery and
disgrace.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Great was the joy which the recovery of the prisoners
diffused throughout the camps of Pollock and Nott; and
great was the joy which it diffused throughout the
provinces of India. Rightly judged Pollock that, if he
returned to Hindostan without the brave men and
tender women who had endured for so many months
the pains and perils of captivity in a barbarous country,
his countrymen would regard the victory as incomplete.
Let him fight what battles, destroy what forts, and
carry off what trophies he might, he would, without
the liberation of the prisoners, be only half-a-conqueror
after all. Pollock knew that his countrymen had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
“thrown the prisoners overboard.” He had rescued them
now from the hands of the enemy; that object of the war
was obtained. There was little else, indeed, now to be
done, except to fix upon Caubul some lasting mark of the
just retribution of an outraged nation. It had been the
declared wish of the Supreme Government that the army
should leave behind it some decisive proof of its power,
without impeaching its humanity; and now Pollock prepared
to carry, as best he could interpret them, those
wishes into effect.</p>

<p>The interpretation, however, was not easy. Very
different opinions obtained among the leading officers in
the British camp respecting the amount of punishment
which it now became the British General to inflict upon the
Afghan capital. It was a moot question, involving many
considerations, and not to be hastily solved; but there
could have been no question whether, at that time, justice
and expediency did not alike require that the inhabitants
of Caubul and the neighbourhood should be protected
against unauthorised acts of depredation and violence.
Against the plunderings of soldiers and camp-followers
Pollock had steadfastly set his face; but in the neighbourhood
of Nott’s camp much was done to destroy the confidence
which Pollock was anxious to re-establish, and to
alarm and irritate the chiefs whom he desired to conciliate.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
After a few days the new minister and Khan Shereen
Khan, the chief of the Kuzzilbashes, determined to represent
to Pollock, in a joint letter, the grievances of which
they thought they were entitled to complain.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The minister had been anxious to pay his respects to
the gallant commander of the Candahar division, and had
waited upon him with a letter from Macgregor; but Nott
had peremptorily refused to give him an audience. He
believed it to be the desire of Lord Ellenborough that no
Afghan Government should be recognised by the British
authorities, and he was unwilling to favour any such
recognition by receiving visits of ceremony from the
functionaries appointed by the government which had been
established at Caubul. As Pollock had not been equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
nice upon this point, the refusal of his brother-general to
extend his courtesies to the minister could only have
embarrassed our supreme authorities at Caubul, and
attached suspicion to the sincerity of our proceedings.
But Nott, at this time, was in no mood of mind to extend
his courtesies either to Afghan or to British authorities.
It was his belief that even then the British army ought
to have been on its way to Jellalabad. He had with him a
sufficiency of supplies to carry him to the latter place;
and was irritated at the thought that Pollock had come
up to Caubul without provisions to carry him back.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> If
he had been in supreme authority at Caubul, he would
have destroyed the Balla Hissar and the city, and would
have marched on with the least possible delay to Jellalabad.
He placed his sentiments on record regarding the impolicy
of the halt at Caubul&mdash;declared that he would be compelled
to make military requisitions to rescue his troops
from starvation; and denounced Futteh Jung and the new
ministers as the enemies of the British. Nothing, indeed,
could dissuade Nott that every Afghan in the country was
not our bitter foe.</p>

<p>Pollock, however, was inclined to discriminate&mdash;to
protect our friends and to punish our enemies. Whilst
supplies were coming in but slowly to his camp, it
seemed good to him that another blow should be struck at
the hostile chiefs. It was reported to him that Ameen-oollah
Khan was in the field at Istaliff, in the Kohistan,
endeavouring to bring together the scattered
fragments of the broken Barukzye force. It was believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to be the design of the chief to attack the British on their
retirement from Caubul; and it was expedient, therefore,
at once to break up his force, and to leave some
mark of our just resentment on a part of the country which
had poured forth so many of the insurgents who had
risen against us in the preceding winter. A force taken
from the two divisions of the British army was therefore
despatched, under General M’Caskill, to Istaliff, to
scatter the enemy there collected, and to destroy the
place. It was thought, moreover, that Ameen-oollah
Khan, dreading the advance of the retributory army,
would endeavour to conciliate the British General, by
delivering up to him the person of Mahomed Akbar Khan,
if he could adroitly accomplish his seizure. The Sirdar
had sent his family and his property into Turkistan; and
was himself waiting the progress of events in the Ghorebund
Pass, ready, it was said, to follow his establishment
across the hills, if the British troops pushed forward to
overtake him.</p>

<p>The hostile chiefs were all now at the last gasp&mdash;all
eager to conciliate the power that a few months before
they had derided and defied. Already had Ameen-oollah
Khan begun to make overtures to the British
authorities&mdash;to declare that he had always at heart been
their friend; but that he had been compelled to secure
his own safety by siding with the Barukzyes. And now
Akbar Khan with the same object, sent into Pollock’s
camp a peace-offering, in the shape of the last remaining
prisoner in his hands. Captain Bygrave was now restored
to his friends. It might have been a feeling of generosity&mdash;for
generous impulses sometimes welled up in the
breast of the Sirdar; it might have been a mere stroke
of policy, having reference solely to his own interests;
or it might, and it probably was, a mixture of the two
influences that prevailed upon him; but he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
any longer make war upon a single man, and upon one,
too, whom he personally respected and esteemed with the
respect and esteem due to a man of such fine qualities
as Bygrave. So he sent the last remaining prisoner safely
into Pollock’s camp; and with him he sent a letter of
conciliation, and an agent commissioned to treat for him.
He was eager to enter into negotiations with the
British. It was little likely that so weak a Prince as
Futteh Jung would be able to maintain his regal authority
in Afghanistan a day after the departure of the
British; and it appeared to him not wholly improbable
that, wishing to leave behind them a friendly power in
Afghanistan, the British authorities might be induced
to enter into a convention with him before their final
departure from the country.</p>

<p>Even now was Futteh Jung himself beginning to acknowledge
his utter inability to maintain himself in the
Balla Hissar after the striking of Pollock’s camp. Pollock
had refused to supply him with troops, money, or
arms; and the Prince himself had closed the door of
reconciliation with his old Barukzye enemies by destroying
their houses and property. Among the houses thus
destroyed, it is deplorable to state, was the house of Mahomed
Zemaun Khan&mdash;the very house in which the good
old man, with real parental kindness, had so long and so
faithfully protected the British hostages. The houses of
Oosman Khan, Jubbar Khan, and others fell also. It was
the policy of the Prince thus to compromise his supporters,
and to prevent an alliance between them and the
Barukzye party; but having done this, he felt that it was
only by destroying the hostile chiefs that he could, in any
way, maintain his position. He watched, therefore, with
anxiety the issue of the expedition into the Kohistan,
and deferred his ultimate decision until the return of
M’Caskill’s force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Aided by and relying on the wise counsels of Havelock,
M’Caskill made a rapid march upon Istaliff, and took
the enemy by surprise. The town is built, terrace above
terrace, upon two ridges of the spur of the Hindoo-Koosh,
which forms the western boundary of the beautiful valley
of Kohistan. It was held in high repute as a maiden
fortress by the Afghans, who had now collected, in its fortified
streets and squares, their treasure and their women.
Looking to it as to a place of refuge, secure from the
assaults of the invading Feringhees, they had scarcely
made any military dispositions. M’Caskill’s first intention
had been to attack the left face of the city; but the intelligence
brought in by a reconnoitering party, on the evening
of his arrival, caused him to change his plan of operations,
and to conduct the assault on the right. Soon
after daybreak, therefore, on the following morning (the
29th of September), the camp was in motion towards
the right of the city. The enemy soon marked the
movement; and, believing that our columns were in
retreat, poured in a sharp fire upon them. Growing
more and more audacious in this belief, the foremost
Afghans pressed closely upon our covering party, which,
composed of Broadfoot’s sappers under their intrepid chief,
soon found themselves in fierce collision with a large body
of the enemy posted in a walled garden. There was a
sturdy hand-to-hand conflict. The little band of sappers
pushed on, and the Afghans retreated before them up the
slopes in the direction of the city, where they would have
been overwhelmed. But the time had now come for operations
on a larger scale. Havelock and Mayne, who had
observed the dangerous position of the sappers, galloped
to the General, and urged the necessity of supporting
Broadfoot. M’Caskill, who had made his arrangements
for the assault, now ordered the columns to advance upon
the city. Her Majesty’s 9th Foot and the 26th Native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Infantry, who had done such good service before,
delighted to receive the word to advance to the support of
the sappers, tore across the intervening space, in generous
emulation, and rushed cheerily to the encounter; whilst
on the other side of the enemy’s position, the light companies
of Her Majesty’s 41st, and the 42nd and 43rd
Sepoy regiments of Bengal, stormed, with steady gallantry,
the village and vineyard to the left. The Afghan
marksmen gave way before our attacking columns; and
as our men pursued them up the slopes, a great panic
seized the people. They thought no longer of defence.
Their first care was to save their property and their
women. Ameen-oollah Khan himself fled at the first
onset. As our troops entered the town, the face of the
mountain beyond was covered with laden baggage-cattle,
whilst long lines of white-veiled women, striving to reach
a place of safety, streamed along the hill-side. The forbearance
of our people was equal to their gallantry.
M’Caskill, respecting the honour of the women, would not
suffer a pursuit; but many fell into the hands of our
soldiers in the town, and were safely delivered over to the
keeping of the Kuzzilbashes.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Two guns and much booty
were taken; the town was partially fired; and then
M’Caskill went on towards the hills, meeting no opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
on the way, destroyed Charekur, where the Goorkha regiment
had been annihilated, and some other fortified
places which had been among the strongholds of the
enemy; and then returned triumphantly to Caubul.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, M’Caskill’s force rejoined the
British camp. It was now necessary that immediate
measures should be adopted for the withdrawal of the
British troops from the capital of Afghanistan. Already
had Pollock exceeded, but with a wise discretion, the
time which the Supreme Government would have accorded
to him. But there was yet work to be done. No
lasting mark of our retributory visit to Caubul had yet
been left upon the accursed city. Pollock had been unable
to shape his measures before, for the nature of the
retribution to be inflicted was dependent upon the constitution
of the new Afghan Government; and it was
long uncertain what government the British General
would leave behind him. Futteh Jung had been for
some time trembling at the thought of the prospect before
him. If M’Caskill had brought back Akbar Khan
a prisoner, or had sent his head to the British camp, the
new King might have summoned resolution to maintain
his seat on the throne. But he could never forget the
treatment he had received from the Sirdar, or nerve
himself again to meet the unscrupulous Barukzye.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> So
now he peremptorily declined to wear the crown which
we would fain have kept a little longer on his head;
and implored the British General to afford him the protection
of his camp, and convey him to the provinces of
India.</p>

<p>Willing to spare the city and the Balla Hissar for the
sake of a friendly government, Pollock had despatched
Shakespear to the Kuzzilbash camp, which was then in
the Kohistan, to take counsel with Khan Shereen Khan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and the other chiefs of the Persian party. It seems that
they had been sceptical of the intentions of the British
General to evacuate the country; but Shakespear now
announced that the departure of the army was at hand,
and that it was necessary finally to determine upon the
nature of the new government. In this conjuncture, the
Kuzzilbashes, trembling for the safety of the city, and
feeling that there was little hope of their being reconciled
to the Barukzye party, laid their hands upon
another puppet. There was a younger scion of the
Suddozye House then at Caubul&mdash;the Prince Shahpoor.
His mother was a high-born Populzye lady, and it was
believed that his recognition would tend to conciliate the
Douranees. Postponing, however, the final enunciation
of their views until their return to Caubul, they now
proposed that the young Prince should be set up in the
place of his brother. At Caubul, a general meeting of
the chiefs was held. The voice of the assembly declared
in favour of the elevation of Shahpoor. The Prince himself,
a high-spirited boy, willingly accepted the crown
that was offered to him, and a declaration to that effect,
from the Wuzeer and the Kuzzilbash chief, was then sent
in to Pollock’s camp.</p>

<p>Determined to make a last effort to obtain substantial
assistance from the British authorities, the chiefs now
waited upon Pollock, and entreated him to leave some
British troops behind him for the support of the new
monarch. Pollock resolutely refused the request. They
then asked him for money. This he also refused. Then
came before them the painful subject of the “mark” that
was to be left on Caubul. The chiefs pleaded for the
city and for the Balla Hissar. Urgently they now set
forth the necessity of a Suddozye Prince maintaining the
appearance of royalty in the palace of his fathers&mdash;urgently
they now set forth that the Arabs and Hindostanees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
who in the hour of extremest peril had been so
faithful to Futteh Jung, were all located in the Balla
Hissar; and that the blow would fall with the greatest
severity on those who were least deserving of punishment.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
So Pollock consented to spare the Balla Hissar.</p>

<p>But it was still necessary that some mark of the retributory
visit of the British should be left upon the offending
city. Pollock, therefore, determined to destroy the
great Bazaar. There the mutilated remains of the murdered
Envoy had been exhibited to the insolent gaze of
the Afghans; and there it was deemed fit that the retributory
blow should fall. So, on the 9th of October,
Abbott, the chief engineer, received instructions from the
General to destroy the Bazaar; but so anxious was
Pollock not to extend the work of destruction, that he
strictly enjoined the engineer to abstain from applying
fire to the building, and even from the employment of
gunpowder, that other parts of the city might not be
damaged by his operations. At the same time, a strong
detachment of British troops, under Colonel Richmond&mdash;one
of the best and ablest officers of the force&mdash;was sent
with the engineers, to protect the town from injury and
the inhabitants from plunder and outrage.</p>

<p>But it was no easy task to destroy that great Bazaar
simply by the work of men’s hands. Abbott did his best
to obey the instructions he had received from the General;
but he was baffled by the massiveness of the buildings on
which he had been sent to operate. It was necessary to
employ a more powerful agent. On his own responsibility,
therefore, he betook himself to the use of gunpowder.
But the explosions damaged no other buildings than those
which had authoritatively been marked for destruction.
The operations against the great Bazaar lasted throughout
the 9th and 10th of October. Every effort was made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
save the city from further destruction; but all Richmond’s
protective measures were insufficient to control the impetuosity
of the soldiers and camp-followers who poured
themselves into the town.</p>

<p>That many excesses were then committed is not to be
denied. The principal gates of the city were guarded;
but there were many other points of ingress, and our
people streamed into the streets of Caubul, applied the
firebrand to the houses, and pillaged the shops. Guilty
and innocent alike fell under the heavy hand of the lawless
retribution which was now to descend upon the
inhabitants of Caubul. Many unoffending Hindoos, who,
lulled into a sense of delusive security by the outward
re-establishment of a government, had returned to the
city and re-opened their shops, were now disastrously
ruined.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In the mad excitement of the hour, friend and
foe were stricken down by the same unsparing hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Even the <i>Chundarwal</i>&mdash;where dwelt the friendly Kuzzilbashes&mdash;narrowly
escaped destruction. Such excesses as
were committed during the three last days of our occupation
of Caubul must ever be deplored, as all human
weakness and wickedness are to be deplored. But when
we consider the amount of temptation and provocation&mdash;when
we remember that the comrades of our soldiers
and the brethren of our camp-followers had been
foully butchered by thousands in the passes of Afghanistan;
that everywhere tokens of our humiliation,
and of the treachery and cruelty of the enemy, rose
up before our people, stinging them past all endurance,
and exasperating them beyond all control, we wonder
less, that when the guilty city lay at their feet, they
should not wholly have reined in their passions, than
that, in such an hour, they should have given them so
little head.</p>

<p>It was now time that the British army should depart.
Nothing remained to be done. Any longer continuance
at Caubul would only have aggravated the sufferings of
the people and increased our own difficulties. So, on
the 11th of October, orders were issued for the commencement
of the march on the following day. The unhappy
Prince, Futteh Jung, had claimed and sought
permission to accompany Pollock’s camp to India, and
to seek an asylum in the Company’s dominions. The
old blind King, Zemaun Shah, after all the vicissitudes
of his eventful life, was now about again to become an
exile, and to end his days in the same hospitable country.
For the family of Shah Soojah protection also had been
sought, and not refused; and now all these fragments of
the great wreck of royalty&mdash;these miserable records of a
most disastrous enterprise&mdash;were committed to the charge
of one who had largely participated in its sufferings, but
had happily escaped the ruin which had overwhelmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
his comrades and his chief.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> On the evening of the 11th
of October they came out of the town, and found safety in
Pollock’s hospitable camp.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The British colours, which
had floated over the Balla Hissar, were now lowered; the
regiment which had been posted there was withdrawn;
and every preparation was made for the departure of the
British army.</p>

<p>On the following morning the two divisions commenced
their march. Fearful that the Candahar division, if left
in occupation of its old ground, whilst the head-quarters
of the army were proceeding in advance, would commit
many unauthorised excesses, Pollock had determined that
the whole force should move on the same day. There
was some inconvenience in this, for Nott’s division came
up before Pollock’s had crossed the Loghur river; but
to the cause of humanity it was, doubtless, great
gain. The unfortunate Hindoos, who had been rendered
destitute by the destruction of Ghuznee and the spoliation
of Caubul, had crowded into the British camps,
hoping to obtain, in their utter misery, safe conduct
to the provinces of India.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Pollock took with him what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
trophies he could, but he had not carriage for all the
guns,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and even on the first day’s march he was compelled
to begin their destruction; whilst Nott, rejoicing in
a letter from the Governor-General, who was in ecstasies
about the gates of Somnauth, and in the notification
of his appointment to the Residency of Lucknow, went
off with those venerable relics, and turned his face
towards the country, from which they had been traditionally
ravished.</p>

<p>And on that day, as Pollock was leaving Caubul, and
Nott was striking his camp, the guns of the Balla Hissar
roared forth a royal salute in honour of the accession of
Prince Shahpoor&mdash;the <i>Fatiha</i> was read in his name, and
the chiefs tendered their allegiance. It was, perhaps, a
mere mockery; but it had saved the Balla Hissar.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> So
the new King was paraded about the streets of Caubul&mdash;only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
to be dethroned again before the British army had
reached the provinces of India; and that army turned
its back upon Afghanistan, not as of old, in the agony of
humiliation and defeat, but in the flush of victory and
triumph.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">[October-December: 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">Effect of the victories&mdash;Lord Ellenborough at Simlah&mdash;The Manifesto
of 1842&mdash;The Proclamation of the Gates&mdash;The Restoration of Dost
Mahomed&mdash;The Gathering at Ferozepore&mdash;Reception of the Troops&mdash;The
Courts-Martial.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Never</span> was intelligence received in India with stronger
and more universal feelings of delight than the intelligence
of the victories of Pollock and Nott; and the happy
recovery of the prisoners. There was one general shout
of triumphant congratulation, caught up from station to
station along the whole line of country from Sirhind to
Tinnevelly. Suspense and anxiety now died away in the
European breast; and, in the words of one of the ablest
Indian statesmen, “it was a comfort again to be able to
look a native in the face.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>To Lord Ellenborough the brilliant achievements of the
two Generals were a source of unbounded gratification.
Everything that he could have desired had been accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Pollock and Nott, under his orders, had
“retired” so adroitly from Afghanistan, that everybody
believed they had advanced upon the capital of the
country. The movement had produced, or was producing,
a grand moral effect all over Hindostan. Again was there
likely to be a season of universal repose. The excitement
which had stirred the hearts of the native community was
now passing away. All those vague hopes and longings
which had sprung up, at the contemplation of our disasters,
in Native States of doubtful friendliness and fidelity,
were now stifled by the knowledge of our success. The
Governor-General had threatened to save India in spite of
every man in it who ought to give him support;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> but it
now seemed as though, in reality, Pollock and Nott had
achieved the work of salvation in spite of the Governor-General
himself.</p>

<p>But Lord Ellenborough was not less delighted than if
the work had been emphatically his own. He was at
Simlah when the glad tidings of the re-occupation of
Caubul reached him. He was at Simlah, and in the very
house which had been the cradle of the great manifesto of
1838, out of which had come all our disasters. He was
at Simlah; and the 1st of October was temptingly at
hand. On the 1st of October, four years before, that
manifesto had been issued. From Simlah, therefore, now,
on the first of October, another manifesto was to be made
to issue. The utter failure of Lord Auckland’s policy in
Afghanistan was to be proclaimed from the very room in
which it had taken shape and consistency.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
very room was to go forth to all the chiefs and people of
India a proclamation, laying bare to the very core the
gigantic errors which had been baptised in the blood of
thousands, and shrouded in contumely and disgrace.</p>

<p>And thus ran the proclamation:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Secret Department, Simlah, the 1st of October, 1842.</i></p>

<p>The Government of India directed its army to pass the Indus
in order to expel from Afghanistan a chief believed to be hostile
to British interests, and to replace upon his throne a sovereign
represented to be friendly to those interests, and popular with his
former subjects.</p>

<p>The chief believed to be hostile became a prisoner, and the sovereign
represented to be popular was replaced upon his throne; but,
after events, which brought into question his fidelity to the government
by which he was restored, he lost by the hands of an assassin
the throne he had only held amidst insurrections, and his death
was preceded and followed by still existing anarchy.</p>

<p>Disasters unparalleled in their extent, unless by the errors in
which they originated, and by the treachery by which they were
completed, have, in one short campaign, been avenged upon every
scene of past misfortune; and repeated victories in the field, and
the capture of the cities and citadels of Ghuznee and Caubul, have
again attached the opinion of invincibility to the British arms.</p>

<p>The British arms in possession of Afghanistan will now be withdrawn
to the Sutlej.</p>

<p>The Governor-General will leave it to the Afghans themselves
to create a government amidst the anarchy which is the consequence
of their crimes.</p>

<p>To force a sovereign upon a reluctant people, would be as inconsistent
with the policy as it is with the principles of the British
Government, tending to place the arms and resources of that
people at the disposal of the first invader, and to impose the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of supporting a sovereign, without the prospect of benefit from his
alliance.</p>

<p>The Governor-General will willingly recognise any government
approved by the Afghans themselves, which shall appear desirous
and capable of maintaining friendly relations with neighbouring
states.</p>

<p>Content with the limits nature appears to have assigned to its
empire the Government of India will devote all its efforts to the
establishment and maintenance of general peace, to the protection
of the sovereigns and chiefs its allies, and to the prosperity and
happiness of its own faithful subjects.</p>

<p>The rivers of the Punjaub and Indus, and the mountainous passes
and the barbarous tribes of Afghanistan, will be placed between
the British army and an enemy approaching from the West, if
indeed such an enemy there can be, and no longer between the
army and its supplies.</p>

<p>The enormous expenditure required for the support of a large
force, in a false military position, at a distance from its own frontier
and its resources, will no longer arrest every measure for the
improvement of the country and of the people.</p>

<p>The combined army of England and of India, superior in equipment,
in discipline, in valour, and in the officers by whom it is
commanded, to any force which can be opposed to it in Asia, will
stand in unassailable strength upon its own soil, and for ever, under
the blessing of Providence, preserve the glorious empire it has won,
in security and in honour.</p>

<p>The Governor-General cannot fear the misconstruction of his
motives in thus frankly announcing to surrounding states the
pacific and conservative policy of his government.</p>

<p>Afghanistan and China have seen at once the forces at his disposal,
and the effect with which they can be applied.</p>

<p>Sincerely attached to peace for the sake of the benefits it confers
upon the people, the Governor-General is resolved that peace shall
be observed, and will put forth the whole power of the British
Government to coerce the state by which it shall be infringed.</p>

<p>By order of the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India.</p>

<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">T. H. Maddock,</span></p>
<p class="pr2">Secretary to the Government of India, with</p>
<p class="pr65">the Governor-General.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">It would have been well if Lord Ellenborough had
resisted the puerile temptation to date this proclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
on the 1st of October. That it was written then is not
to be doubted. But, though written, it was not issued.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
The Governor-General was not prepared to issue it.
There was no immediate necessity, indeed, for the preparation
of such a notification as this. It might have
been delayed for a few weeks without injury to the state;
whilst, on the other hand, it could not have been delayed
for a few days without great advantage to Lord Ellenborough.
On the 1st of October, the Governor-General
knew that the British ensign was floating over the Balla
Hissar of Caubul; but he did not know that the British
prisoners had been released from captivity. Had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
suppressed the inclination to write “<i>October 1</i>” at the
head of his proclamation, he might have announced in it
the attainment of all those objects which his countrymen
had at heart, and fully declared that the war was at an
end. But there were not wanting those who now commented
bitterly on the fact that this proclamation was
drawn up by the Governor-General of India whilst yet in
ignorance of the fate of the prisoners. The delay of a
few days would have placed him in possession of the intelligence,
for which all India was looking with the deepest
interest and anxiety; but the temptation of the “1st of
October” was not to be resisted; and Lord Ellenborough
sacrificed his character for humanity for the sake of a
little dramatic effect.</p>

<p>Having drawn up this proclamation, and handed it over
to the translators to be arrayed in Oriental costume,
Lord Ellenborough began to take counsel with Sir Jasper
Nicolls on the subject of the honorary distinctions to be
conferred on the officers and men who had gained these
great victories in Afghanistan; and to draft another
proclamation to be issued to the Chiefs and Princes of
India. This was the famous proclamation of the Gates.
On the 5th of October, he sent a rough draft of it to Sir
Jasper Nicolls, inviting the comments of the Chief. Freely
asked, they were freely given. What they were is not on
record. The Governor-General took the comments of the
Commander-in-Chief “in good part,” and was not wholly
impervious to the criticism of the veteran commander.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Subjected to a long and laborious incubation, this
address to “all the Princes, chiefs, and people of India,”
was translated into the Persian and Hindee languages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
circulated among those to whom it especially appealed,
and finally published in its English dress on the 16th of
November.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> It was by no means, therefore, an ebullition
of impulse and enthusiasm on the part of the Governor-General,
but the result of many weeks of thought and
study, and, perhaps, much consultation with others. The
Duke of Wellington called it a “Song of triumph.” Thus
rose the pæan, in its English dress:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pc1 lmid">FROM THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL TO ALL THE PRINCES AND CHIEFS,
AND PEOPLE OF INDIA.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My Brothers and my Friends,</span></p>

<p class="phb">Our victorious army bears the gates of the temple of Somnauth
in triumph from Afghanistan, and the despoiled tomb of
Sultan Mahomed looks upon the ruins of Ghuznee.</p>

<p>The insult of eight hundred years is at last avenged. The gates
of the temple of Somnauth, so long the memorial of your humiliation,
are become the proudest record of your national glory
the proof of your superiority in arms over the nations beyond the
Indus.</p>

<p>To you, Princes and Chiefs of Sirhind, of Rajwarra, of Malwa,
and of Guzerat, I shall commit this glorious trophy of successful
war.</p>

<p>You will yourselves, with all honour, transmit the gates of
sandal-wood through your respective territories to the restored
temple of Somnauth.</p>

<p>The chiefs of Sirhind shall be informed at what time our victorious
army will first deliver the gates of the temple into their guardianship,
at the foot of the bridge of the Sutlej.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">My Brothers and my Friends,</span></p>

<p class="phb">I have ever relied with confidence upon your attachment to
the British Government. You see how worthy it proves itself of
your love, when, regarding your honour as its own, it exerts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
power of its arms to restore to you the gates of the temple of
Somnauth, so long the memorial of your subjection to the Afghans.</p>

<p>For myself, identified with you in interest and in feeling, I
regard with all your own enthusiasm the high achievements of that
heroic army; reflecting alike immortal honour upon my native and
upon my adopted country.</p>

<p>To preserve and to improve the happy union of our two countries,
necessary as it is to the welfare of both, is the constant object of
my thoughts. Upon that union depends the security of every ally,
as well as of every subject of the British Government, from the
miseries whereby, in former times, India was afflicted: through
that alone has our army now waved its triumphant standards over
the ruins of Ghuznee, and planted them upon the Balla Hissar of
Caubul.</p>

<p>May that good Providence, which has hitherto so manifestly
protected me, still extend to me its favour, that I may so use the
power now entrusted to my hands, as to advance your prosperity
and secure your happiness, by placing the union of our two
countries upon foundations which may render it eternal.</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Ellenborough.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">No document that ever emanated from the bureau of a
statesman has been overwhelmed with so much ridicule as
this. It is still fresh in the recollection of men who
dwelt in India at this time, how the authenticity of the
proclamation was gravely doubted&mdash;how many, at first,
declared their conviction that it was a newspaper satire
upon the Napoleonic style of address which Lord Ellenborough
had recently adopted; and how at last, when
it came to be known&mdash;thoroughly known and understood&mdash;that
it was a genuine emanation from the “Political
Department,” with the right official stamp upon it, such
a flood of ridicule and censure was let loose upon it as had
never before descended upon an Indian state-paper. The
folly of the thing was past all denial. It was a folly, too,
of the most senseless kind, for it was calculated to please
none and to offend many. It was addressed to “all the
Princes and Chiefs, and People of India.” The “Brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and Friends” thus grandiloquently apostrophised, were a
mixed family of Mahomedans and Hindoos. Upon the
Mahomedans it was an open and most intelligible outrage.
To the Hindoos, the pompous offer of the polluted gates of
Somnauth was little better than a covert insult. The
temple to which it was to have been restored was in ruins,
and the sacred ground trodden by Mahomedans. Looking
at the effusion from the Oriental side, it was altogether a
failure and an abortion.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Among Europeans, worldly
men scouted the proclamation as a folly, and religious
men denounced it as a crime. It was said to be both
dangerous and profane. The question suggested by the
latter epithet I do not propose to discuss; but of the
dangers of such a proclamation it may be said that they
existed only in the imaginations of those who discerned
them. It was altogether an event of no political importance.
In Afghanistan, the rape of the Gates created
little or no sensation. In India, the proclamation produced
no excitement among the “brothers and friends”
to whom it was addressed. The effect of the measure
was personal to Lord Ellenborough himself. It damaged
his reputation, and left the rest of the world as it was
before.</p>

<p>But there was another proclamation published about
this time&mdash;launched into the world, indeed, before the
proclamation of the Gates, but of a somewhat later conception.
The Afghan drama was now well-nigh played
out. The Afghan policy of Lord Auckland had been
publicly declared a failure, and the grounds on which it
had been originated wholly a mistake. Everything,
indeed, was to be reversed. The Tripartite treaty was
at an end. Shah Soojah was dead. The people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Afghanistan had felt an obvious distaste for foreign interference,
and had evinced it in a very unmistakeable
manner. The Suddozye Princes had demonstrated the
feebleness of the tenure by which they could hope to
maintain possession of the throne. It was impossible
wholly to revert to the state of things that had existed
in 1838, for thousands of lives and millions of money had
been buried in the passes of Afghanistan&mdash;and there was
no earthly resurrection or restoration for them. But
there was one victim of the war in Afghanistan for whom
restoration was yet possible. The first victim of our
national injustice was yet a prisoner in the hands of the
British. The Governor-General had publicly announced,
in his proclamation of the 1st of October, that Dost
Mahomed was only “believed to be hostile to British
interests,” and that Shah Soojah was only “represented”
to be friendly to those interests, and popular with his own
people. It was announced, too, in this proclamation,
that the British Government had determined to leave the
Afghans to form a government for themselves, and to
recognise that government when formed. After such
announcements as these, the retention of Dost Mahomed
in captivity would have been confessedly inconsistent and
unjust.</p>

<p>Ever since the intelligence of the outbreak at Caubul
had reached the provinces of Hindostan, Dost Mahomed
had been watched with greater suspicion, and guarded
with greater care. It was believed that he would place
himself in communication with the leaders of the revolutionary
party, and would make an effort to escape from the
captivity which embittered his lot. It does not appear,
however, that he manifested any feelings of exultation at
the thought of the calamities which had befallen his
captors, or, in any way, desired to increase the difficulties
which surrounded them. On the other hand, he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
willing, if not anxious, to impart to the British Government,
through Captain Nicolson, such local information
as he thought would be serviceable to them in the conjuncture
which had arisen; and even offered suggestions
tending to facilitate their re-invasion of his country. The
vigilance with which he was guarded, and the consequent
inconveniences to which he was subjected, seemed to
cause him much vexation and annoyance. He always
protested that he knew nothing of the secret history of
the Caubul outbreak&mdash;that it was his belief the Suddozyes
had instigated it, as no other family in Afghanistan, since
the overthrow of the Barukzyes, had sufficient influence
to initiate a great national movement. Any expression
or intimation of a doubt of his honesty seemed to pain
him. “Recollect,” he said, on one occasion to Captain
Nicolson, “that I have, from the first day I came in, been
on your side, heart and soul. I swear by the most holy
God, that since my submission I have not communicated
with Caubul and its people, except through you. But it
is possible that news may have reached my sister at
Loodianah through her other brothers. I am your guest
or your prisoner, whichever you please. I came to you
in the hope of being in time employed by you; and I
should say what is not true, if I denied still entertaining
that hope; and I am ready to lay down my life in your
service.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> It may be doubted whether he entertained
any hope, or any desire to regain the dominion he
had lost. He had resigned himself submissively to his
fate. If it seemed to be the will of God that he
should return to Caubul, he was willing to retrace his steps
to the Balla Hissar. But he was little inclined to take
into his own hands the shaping of his future destinies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
and to win his way back to empire by violence or
fraud.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>It has been seen that the Government of India, ever
since the disastrous downfall of our efforts to prop up the
Suddozye dynasty, had contemplated the possibility of
restoring Dost Mahomed to the country from which we
had expelled him. Lord Auckland had hinted at the
restoration of the ex-Ameer as a measure to which, under
certain circumstances, he would offer no opposition. He
would gladly, indeed, have availed himself of the opportunity
afforded, by a proposed interchange of prisoners, to
render tardy justice to the man whom he had so palpably
wronged. The subsequent progress of events had tended
to render more and more obvious the propriety of this
resolution. It was now plainer than ever that the retention
of Dost Mahomed as a prisoner of state could no
longer be justified, on the score of either political rectitude
or expediency. So Lord Ellenborough did, as it became
him to do. He issued a proclamation, setting forth that
when the “British army returning from Afghanistan
shall have passed the Indus, all the Afghans now in the
power of the British Government shall be permitted to
return to their country.” This was equally reasonable and
just. But the proclamation was not without characteristic
disfigurements, for the Governor-General, who had set his
heart upon a grand pageant at Ferozepore, added a codicil,
to the effect that the released Afghan Princes were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
present themselves, before returning to their desolated
country, at the Durbar of the Governor-General in his
camp at Ferozepore.</p>

<p>The popular feeling against this contemplated outrage
was strong and universal. There was not a generous
mind in the country which did not feel deeply the wrong
that was to be done to these unfortunate Princes. But
the Governor-General, in a better hour, conscious of error,
consented to forego the pitiful delight of gracing his
triumph with the presence of a dethroned monarch, whose
national feelings were not so wholly extinguished by exile
as to render his appearance at the Ferozepore festivities
anything but a painful and humiliating trial. The order
issued in thoughtlessness was revoked in good feeling; and
Dost Mahomed, without suffering this last crowning
injury at the hands of the British Government, returned
to Afghanistan, with hopes and expectations falling far
short of the long years of restored dominion, which
actually lay before him.</p>

<p>Quitting Simlah, the Governor-General moved down to
the plains of Ferozepore. There an army, under the personal
command of Sir Jasper Nicolls, was now assembled.
It had been originally projected by Lord Auckland, at a
time when it was believed that the presence of such an
army on our north-western frontier would have a great
moral effect upon the neighbouring states. It has been
said, that when it did assemble, at the commencement of
the cold season of 1842-1843, it was intended to answer
no other purpose than that of a vast pageant; that the
Governor-General had determined on celebrating the
return of the victorious armies with all possible pomp;
and that he looked forward, with childish delight and
anxiety, to the magnificent <i>fête champêtre</i> of which he had
appointed himself director-in-chief. It must be admitted
that Lord Ellenborough took a somewhat undignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
interest in the details of these puerilities; but the justice
of the assertion, that the army was kept together for no
other purpose than that of presenting arms to the “Illustrious
Garrison” of Jellalabad, and turning out for a
grand field-day, may be reasonably disputed. The fidelity
of the Sikhs had long been suspected. It was now considered
by no means an impossible event, that the march
of our army, worn, sick, and incumbered, through the
Punjab, would offer a temptation too strong to be resisted
by the mutinous Sikh soldiery, whose real feeling had
betrayed itself early in the year at Peshawur. Had the
Governor-General felt secure in the reality of the formal
alliance with the Punjab, he might have dispersed the
Army of Reserve when the Afghanistan force crossed the
Attock. Such expositions of the military resources of a
great nation are never wholly without profit in such
troubled times; and as doubts, and not unreasonable
doubts, of Sikh fidelity had arisen, it was sound policy to
keep a force on the frontier until the returning troops had
actually crossed the Sutlej.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December the Governor-General arrived
at Ferozepore. The Army of Reserve was drawn out to
receive him. A noble sight, it must have stirred the
heart of one who loved to express his regret that circumstances
had not made him a soldier. There was much
work to be done; and he flung himself into it with
characteristic energy, resolute to give the returning
warriors an honourable reception, and to dazzle the eyes
of all the native potentates who could be lured to the
scene of triumph. Four years before there had been a
grand gathering at the same place, when Runjeet Sing
and Lord Auckland had exchanged courtesies, and the
army of the Indus had commenced its march for the
invasion of the Douranee Empire. The war in Afghanistan
had opened with a grand spectacle at Ferozepore;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and now, with due dramatic propriety, it was to close
with a similar effect. The Maharajah of the Punjab,
with his ministers of state and his principal military
chiefs, were invited to grace the festival.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The Princes of
Sirhind, and other “brothers and friends,” were asked
to take part in the rejoicings. And everywhere from
the neighbouring stations, under lordly encouragement,
flocked our English ladies to Ferozepore&mdash;the wives
and daughters of the returning warriors and of the
officers there assembled&mdash;and everywhere was a flutter
of excitement, such as had not been known in those
regions for years.</p>

<p>Day after day, as Lord Ellenborough busied himself
with his preparations for the reception of the victorious
Generals, tidings reached him from their camps. There
was nothing in this intelligence to dim the pleasure which
was animating his Lordship’s breast. Pollock had brought
back his army with little loss through the formidable
passes of Afghanistan, and was now making an uninterrupted
march through the Punjab. The withdrawal of
the force had been looked forward to with some anxiety
by many, who believed that the tribes would harass the
rear of the retiring army, and work them grievous annoyance.
But so completely had the strength of the Afghans
been broken by continual defeat, that they made no
energetic or combined effort to annoy the British columns
on their line of march. Pollock wrote that he had not
seen an enemy; but M’Caskill and Nott, who followed
with the centre and the rear divisions, were not quite so
fortunate. From Caubul to Jellalabad, however, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
was little to contend against, except some desultory night
attacks on our baggage.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> There was, indeed, no organised
resistance.</p>

<p>The entire force assembled at Jellalabad; and halted
there for a few days. Pollock had determined to destroy
the defences of the place. When the British army was
halting at Peshawur in the spring, the question of the
transfer of Jellalabad to the Sikhs, as a <i>douceur</i> to ensure
cordiality of co-operation with us, had been earnestly discussed,
but at that time the project had fallen to the
ground. It was felt, that so long as Shah Soojah survived,
and the Tripartite treaty had not been annulled, any
design to dissever the Douranee Empire, and to invite the
Sikhs to share in the partition, would be premature, both
as regarded the justice and the expediency of the measure.
But the death of Shah Soojah gave a new aspect to the
state of affairs; and the British Government lost little
time, after authentic intelligence of that event had been
received, in communicating to Mr. Clerk its willingness that
certain territories on the right bank of the Indus should
pass into the possession of the Sikh Government or of the
Jummoo Rajahs, with the permission of the Lahore
Durbar; and it was intimated that the British Government
would facilitate the accomplishment of this object
by placing Jellalabad in the hands of the Sikhs. The
offer was formally made; but, in the then uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
position of affairs, prudently declined. It was not unreasonably
urged by the Durbar, that until they were
in possession of the ultimate intentions of the British
with respect to Afghanistan, it would be hardly politic
in the Sikhs to place themselves in a prominent position,
or in any way to identify themselves with measures the
future out-turn of which they could as yet but dimly foresee.
But it was believed, that as soon as ever our withdrawal
from Afghanistan was fully determined upon, and
about to be put in execution, the Sikhs, without further
explanation, would be willing to take possession of Jellalabad.
And they were so; but not having fully made up
their minds upon the subject (probably from some mistrust
of our intentions) until the British force had actually
marched from Caubul, their acceptance of the offer came
too late to save the place from destruction. General
Pollock had, in accordance with instructions, destroyed
the fortifications of Jellalabad before he received a communication
from the Government, intended, if possible,
to arrest such proceeding, and ordering him to
make over the place uninjured to our allies. It may be
doubted whether either party very much regretted the
accident.</p>

<p>Having destroyed the defences of Jellalabad, Pollock
pushed on to Peshawur. The Khybur Pass had now to be
traversed again. The Afreedi Maliks offered to sell us a
free passage; but Mackeson answered that Pollock would
take one. The first division, under the General himself,
who effectively crowned the heights as he advanced, passed
through with only the loss of two or three privates.
M’Caskill was not equally successful. He had not taken
the same precautions, and the Khyburees came down
upon the rear-guard, under their old enemy, Brigadier
Wild. Favoured by the darkness of night, they rushed
among our people, and threw them into confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Two of our officers were killed,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and two of our guns
were abandoned. But the chief object of the Khyburees
seems to have been plunder. They made no effort to
carry off the guns.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Altogether, the return march of the British troops was
singularly peaceful and uneventful. If the same precautions
to crown the heights along the line of march, as
were systematically taken by Pollock, had been taken by
M’Caskill and Nott, it may be doubted whether we should
even have heard of the appearance of an enemy. The
Afghans are famous plunderers, and they are habitually
armed. When they saw their opportunity, they came
down upon our baggage-laden columns, and molested us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
as best they could. But there was nothing like organised
resistance.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>The fortress of Ali-Musjid was destroyed, and the army
then pushed on to Peshawur. Having partaken of Avitabile’s
magnificent hospitality, the victorious Generals commenced
their march through the Punjab. It was an
uneventful, but a melancholy one. Sickness broke out
in the returning army. There had always been a scarcity
of carriage-cattle, and now the number of sick made it
more severely felt. But all the inconveniences of the march
were from within. The Sikhs wrought us no annoyance.</p>

<p>Whilst such were the tidings from the returning army
which reached the Governor-General in the midst of his
preparations, there came from Afghanistan intelligence
of a more dubious and, at the same time, a less interesting
character. Lord Ellenborough had left the Afghans
to suffer the punishment due to their crimes; and it
little mattered to him whether one party or another were
dominant at Caubul. But the news which now reached
him from the Afghan capital all went to show that the
Suddozye Princes were utterly destitute of power and
influence; and that the new government had not the
means of supporting the youthful puppet upon the throne.
The Wuzeer had sought to re-establish the supremacy of
the Douranees, had hedged in the new King with
Douranee influences, and by his exclusiveness given
general offence. The downfall of the Suddozye Prince
followed rapidly upon this.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Akbar Khan had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
biding his time about the regions of the Hindoo-Koosh.
He was in no hurry to return to Caubul. It was more
prudent to leave the dissensions which were certain to
arise at the capital to work out their own debilitating
effects upon those in power, and pave the way for his
triumphant return to the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, after a time, there came into Ferozepore
tidings, forwarded from Pollock’s camp, to the effect that
the Suddozye prince, Shahpoor, had been expelled from
the Balla Hissar, and had fled for safety to Peshawur.
The poor boy had narrowly escaped with his life.
Akbar Khan had made a descent upon Caubul, and
carried everything before him. The Newab Zemaun
Khan, it was said, had been made Governor of Jellalabad,
Shumshoodeen of Ghuznee, Sultan Jan of Candahar; and
in the meanwhile Dost Mahomed was making his way
through the Punjab to his old principality. “Everything,”
it was added, with bitter significance, “is reverting
to the old state of things&mdash;as it was before we
entered the country.”</p>

<p>And now the heart of the Governor-General began to
beat with expectation of the immediate arrival of the
victorious armies. Everything was ready for their reception.
The army of reserve was spread out over the
great plain of Ferozepore. Triumphal arches had been
erected. A temporary bridge had been thrown across
the Sutlej. The elephants, no insignificant portion of
the coming spectacle, had been gorgeously painted and
decorated, and tricked out in their gayest trappings and
caparisons; and as much of tinsel, and bamboo-work, and
coloured cloth, as could give effect to the triumph, had
been expended to grace the occasion. On the 17th of
December, Sir Robert Sale crossed the Sutlej at the head
of that gallant body of troops which had composed the
garrison of Jellalabad. The Governor-General went forth
to meet them. A street of two hundred and fifty
elephants, more or less caparisoned, had been formed,
and through this marched the heroes of Jellalabad&mdash;the
13th Light Infantry, Sale’s own regiment, at the head of
the column; but although the docile animals had been
instructed to make a simultaneous salaam at a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
signal, and to snort out a note of welcome from their
huge trunks, they resolutely refused to make an obeisance,
and were obstinately silent as the Illustrious Garrison
filed between the huge walls of caparisoned flesh. The
morning was dull and lowering&mdash;not a gleam of sunshine
lighted up the festive scene; but there were sunny hearts
and bright faces; and as the horse-artillery guns boomed
forth their welcome, and the band of the Lancers struck
up the ever-animating “Conquering Hero” tune, and each
regiment in succession, as the column passed on, saluted
their long-absent comrades, the heart must have been a
dull one that did not acknowledge that there is something
of a bright side even to the picture of war.</p>

<p>On the 19th, General Pollock crossed the Sutlej; and
on the 23rd, General Nott arrived, bringing with him
the gates of Somnauth.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Then there was feasting and
festivity in the gigantic tents, hung with silken flags, on
which, in polyglot emblazonments, were the names of
the actions that had been fought; many complimentary
effusions, in the shape of after-dinner harangues;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and in
the mornings, grand field-days, more or less, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the “skyey influences.” The year&mdash;a most eventful one&mdash;was
closed with a grand military display. The plain
was covered with British and Sikh troops, and in the
presence of Pertaub Singh, the heir apparent of Lahore;
Dhyan Singh, the minister; the Governor-General, the
Commander-in-Chief, and others of less note, some forty
thousand men, with a hundred guns, were manœuvred
on the great plain. On this grand tableau the curtain
fell; and the year opportunely closed in gaiety and
glitter&mdash;in prosperity and parade.</p>

<p>The Sepoy regiments having been feasted with their
“favourite <i>mehtoys</i>” (sweetmeats), and the important
event announced in a Government notification, the army
of reserve was broken up;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> but not before the Governor-General,
moved by that characteristic admiration of
gallantry, which earned for him in India the title of the
“Friend of the Army,” had done all that lay in his
power to reward the troops who had achieved such
brilliant successes. The honours which he could not
bestow he solicited from the Crown, on behalf of the
brave men who had so fairly earned them; and the distribution
of honorary distinctions which ensued gave
almost universal satisfaction, It erred rather on the side
of liberality; and, perhaps, there are some old soldiers,
in the scantily-decorated Queen’s army, who think that
during the last few years, honours have been bestowed so
profusely as to lower their real value, by showing how
easily they are to be earned. But it is better to err on
the side of liberality than of chariness&mdash;better even that
the unworthy should be decorated, than that the worthy
should pine in vain for distinction.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was still something more to be done. The
prisoners, towards whom the flood of sympathy had
been setting in so strongly for many months, and whom
the English in India now welcomed back with cordiality
and delight, were not to be suffered all at once to sink
into privacy and obscurity. Some of them were to be
tried by courts-martial, or to be summoned before courts
of inquiry, for abandoning their posts, going over to the
enemy, or otherwise disgracing themselves. The courts
sate, but they could not pronounce the officers arraigned
before them guilty of any offence. Brigadier Shelton was
acquitted. Colonel Palmer,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Captains Anderson, Boyd,
Troup, and Waller, and Lieutenant Eyre, were honourably
acquitted; and the court of inquiry, over which Mr.
Clerk presided, must have risen from its investigation
into the conduct of Major Pottinger with increased respect
for the high soldierly qualities of the young officer who
had beaten back the Persians at Herat, and protested
against the capitulation of Caubul in the teeth of all the
veterans of the force.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1843, Dost Mahomed arrived
at Lahore, on his way to the frontier of Afghanistan, and
was honourably received by the Sikh Durbar. The Suddozye
Princes and their families, to whose reception in
the British provinces Lord Ellenborough had evinced an
insuperable repugnance, found an asylum in the Sikh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
dominions;<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and British connection with Afghanistan was
now fairly at an end.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be said. The proclamations
which were issued by the Supreme Government of India
in the autumn of 1842, are in themselves the best commentaries
on the war in Afghanistan. The Governor-General
of 1842 passed sentence of condemnation upon
the measures of the Governor-General of 1838. No
failure so total and overwhelming as this is recorded
in the page of history. No lesson so grand and impressive
is to be found in all the annals of the world.
Of the secondary causes which contributed to the utter
prostration of an unholy policy, much, at different times,
has been written in the course of this narrative; much
more might now be written, in conclusion, of the mighty
political and military errors which were baptised in the
blood and tears of our unhappy countrymen. These
errors are so patent&mdash;are so intelligible&mdash;they have been
so often laid bare by the hand of the anatomist&mdash;and
they have been so copiously illustrated in these volumes,
that I do not now purpose to enlarge upon them before
I lay down my pen. But if none of these causes had
been in operation to defeat and frustrate our policy, it
must still have broken down under the ruinous expenditure
of public money which the armed occupation of
Afghanistan entailed upon the Government of India.
It is upon record, that this calamitous war cost the
natives of India, whose stewards we are, some fifteen
millions of money. All this enormous burden fell upon
the revenues of India, and the country for long years
afterwards groaned under the weight. The bitter injustice
of this need hardly be insisted upon. The Afghan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
war was neither initiated by the East India Company, nor
at any stage approved of by that great body. The
ministers of the crown were responsible for the invasion
of Afghanistan, but the revenues of the East India Company,
in spite of a feeble effort to shift a part of the
burden on to the British Exchequer, were condemned to
bear the expense. It was adroitly designed, indeed, from
the beginning, that the Company should bear the charges
of the expedition.</p>

<p>And what was gained by the war? What are the
advantages to be summed up on the other side of the
account? The expedition across the Indus was undertaken
with the object of erecting in Afghanistan a barrier
against encroachment from the West. The advance of
the British army was designed to check the aggressions
of Persia on the Afghan frontier, and to baffle Russian
intrigues, by the substitution of a friendly for an unfriendly
power in the countries beyond the Indus. After
an enormous waste of blood and treasure, we left
every town and village of Afghanistan bristling with our
enemies. Before the British army crossed the Indus, the
English name had been honoured in Afghanistan. Some
dim traditions of the splendour of Mr. Elphinstone’s
mission had been all that the Afghans associated with
their thoughts of the English nation; but, in their place,
we left galling memories of the progress of a desolating
army. The Afghans are an unforgiving race; and everywhere,
from Candahar to Caubul, and from Caubul to
Peshawur, were traces of the injuries we had inflicted
upon the tribes. There was scarcely a family in the
country which had not the blood of kindred to revenge
upon the accursed Feringhees. The door of reconciliation
seemed to be closed against us; and if the hostility of the
Afghans be an element of weakness, it seemed certain that
we must have contrived to secure it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said that the tendency of all these great
movements in Central Asia has been to diminish the
mutual jealousies and apprehensions of the British and
the Muscovite powers, by revealing, in all their true proportions,
the tremendous quicksands which lie waiting to
engulph our armies in the inhospitable countries between
the borders of the Russian and the Indian Empires.
But although both states have learnt&mdash;the one from her
Afghan, the other from her Khivan expedition&mdash;terrible
lessons not to be forgotten, it may still be questioned
whether the Cossack and the Sepoy are further apart
than they were. The “Macadamisation” of Sindh and
the Punjab has given England a forward position,
which, advantageous as it is in itself, may have stimulated
Russia to increased activity, whilst our awful
disasters in Afghanistan have encouraged anew the
aggressions of the Persian, and the intrigues of his
Muscovite ally, by revealing the sources of our disinclination
to entangle our armies again in its perilous defiles.</p>

<p>It needed but the announcement of the arrival of a
Persian army at Herat, and the establishment of Persian
dominion in the province, to consummate the completeness
of the failure. After a lapse of twenty years from
the date of the first siege of Herat, we found that the
very event which had stimulated our English statesmen
to decree the invasion of Afghanistan, had actually come
to pass. The Shah of Persia had conquered Herat, and
his viceroy held the key of the “Gate of India” in his
hand. It was still believed to be essential to the security
of our Indian empire either to maintain the integrity
of Herat, as an independent principality, or to attach it to
the territories of the <i>de facto</i> ruler of Afghanistan. Dost
Mahomed was still that ruler. For some time after his
restoration, he had been the enemy of the British Government;
but, as years passed, and the memory of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
humiliation grew fainter and fainter, he had come to
recognise the wisdom of an alliance with his opponents;
and, in 1852, a treaty of general alliance between the two
states was concluded at Herat, by Hyder Khan and
John Lawrence. When, therefore, in 1856, the usurpations
of the Shah of Persia again roused England to a
sense of the necessity of “doing something” to wrest
Herat from his grasp, she found in the Caubul Ameer
a willing, because an interested, ally. The very policy
which ought to have been pursued in 1837&mdash;the policy
which was recommended by Sir John M’Neill&mdash;is that
which then presented itself, but under what altered circumstances,
for our adoption. If, instead of expelling
Dost Mahomed from his principality, we had advanced
him a little money to raise, and lent him a few officers to
drill, an army, the Persians would not, twenty years afterwards,
have been lining the walls of Herat. When the
old difficulty, therefore, presented itself with a new face
in 1856, England adopted, in a modified form this once-rejected
policy. She supplied money and arms to Dost
Mahomed, to enable him to resist the tide of Kujjur
invasion. Because Persia was aggressive on one side of the
Afghan frontier, she meditated no aggressions on the other.
She did not make war upon the ruler of Afghanistan,
in revenge for hostile intrigues at the Persian capital, and
hostile movements in the Persian camp. But when
Persia offended her she struck promptly at Persia. The
demonstration was successful. Under a treaty, signed at
Paris by the English and Persian ambassadors, Herat
was evacuated, and all claims to sovereignty yielded by
the Shah; and, whatever may be its results,&mdash;whatever
may be the verdict of history upon the policy of the
Persian War of 1856-1857, it will at least be recorded,
that it had not, like the war which I have endeavoured to
chronicle, the foul stain of injustice upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether, as many now contend, a later and more
terrible disaster owes primarily its origin to our humiliating
expulsion from Afghanistan, it is not my duty to
inquire. The calamity of 1842 was retribution sufficient,
without any conjectural additions, to stamp in indelible
characters upon the page of history, the great truth that
the policy which was pursued in Afghanistan was unjust,
and that, therefore, it was signally disastrous. It was, in
principle and in act, an unrighteous usurpation, and the
curse of God was on it from the first. Our successes at
the outset were a part of the curse. They lapped us in
false security, and deluded us to our overthrow. This is
the great lesson to be learnt from the contemplation of
all the circumstances of the Afghan War&mdash;“The Lord
God of recompenses shall surely requite.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE COMMAND OF THE CAUBUL ARMY.&mdash;WILLIAMS, LUMLEY,
AND POLLOCK.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 1, pages 19, 20.</i>]</p>

<p class="p2">On the 20th of November the Commander-in-Chief wrote
to Lord Auckland: “I purpose that H.M.’s 9th should
proceed with the second army. This corps is 900 and
upwards strong, including serjeants and drummers. The
Buffs are somewhat nearer, but they have been nineteen
and a-half years out of England, and should be moved
towards Calcutta for early embarkation, especially as the
49th and 55th are so far out of reach. The Buffs have now
nearly 200 men in hospital. The right to join, which the
Court’s order gives to Major-General Sir Edmund Williams,
may be especially dispensed with by your Lordship, should
you not choose to give him the command. Sir Edmund is
in very good health, a hale, strong man&mdash;moreover, was
Lieutenant-Colonel of a Light Infantry battalion of Portuguese
in the Peninsular war.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, Sir Jasper Nicolls wrote to
Lord Auckland: “I very much regret that the state of
Major-General Lumley’s health entirely forbids the hope of
his being able to undertake the command of the troops
advancing to Peshawur. If, therefore, the force is raised to
six regiments, I shall order the Major-General Sir Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Williams to join my camp by dawk, and push him forward,
as soon as I shall have furnished him with instructions, and
armed him with all the information and advice which the
known state of affairs at his departure may seem to require.”&mdash;[<i>Papers
relating to Military Operations in Afghanistan.</i>]</p>

<p>“In your Lordship’s letter of the 8th, you have, I think,
given a preference to General Nott, wherefore Sir E. Williams
need not be disturbed. To send him to Cawnpore
merely to force his way to Jellalabad and Caubul, and then
return, giving over the command to a junior officer, would,
I think, be unfair. As to his holding the chief command,
it is a matter of no moment to me. The officer to command,
if your Lordship could find such a man, should be also the
Envoy&mdash;a Malcolm, Close, or Ochterlony.”&mdash;[<i>Sir Jasper
Nicolls to Lord Auckland: December 19, 1841. MS. Correspondence.</i>]
“Twice I laid before the Governor-General the
name of Major-General Sir Edmund Williams, and as a
Light Infantry officer he was deemed most qualified to meet
an enemy in a mountainous country; he was active, zealous,
and in perfect health. In the command of a division he
had shown a clear judgment, and given me satisfaction....
The Governor-General gave such an unwilling and discouraging
reply to my second communication, that I clearly
saw the whole onus of the appointment and its consequences
would be mine.”&mdash;[<i>Sir J. Nicolls to Lord Fitzroy Somerset:
September 2, 1842. MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p>“In obedience to your Lordship’s wishes, that Major-General
Lumley should be placed in command of the force
assembling at Peshawur, I requested his attendance at my
tent, and placed the despatch now acknowledged (<i>Governor-General
in Council to Sir J. Nicolls: December 15, 1841</i>)
in his hands. The general is still very weak, though improved
in health; he is willing to proceed, but requested
that his medical adviser should be consulted as to his ability
to undertake such a service. Assistant-Surgeon Turner
decidedly assured me that his state of health would by no
means admit of the required exertion and exposure.”&mdash;[<i>Sir
J. Nicolls to Government: December 24, 1841. Papers

<p class="pc2 lmid">LORD AUCKLAND AND THE RETRIEVAL QUESTION.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 1, page 27.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">Lord Auckland’s private letters to the Commander-in-Chief
exhibit better than anything else the alternations in
the Governor-General’s opinions. On the 3rd of January
he wrote: “It is melancholy to think how mighty interests
may be compromised by such errors as seem to have been
committed. Our officers are very wild in their requisitions.
We have given all that we can prudently give&mdash;perhaps
even more; and the chance of operations must be measured
by those means.”&mdash;On the 5th of January, after describing
the tidings from Caubul as “inexplicable as they are appalling,”
and declaring that he “was prepared for everything
but for such misdirection and misconduct as seem to have
taken place,” he proceeded to say, “I can make no further
suggestions to you until I know more; but you may shortly
have to consider what instructions should be given to
General Sale, and as to whether it may not be better that
he should fight down, than that Brigadier Wild or General
Pollock should fight up, the pass. This must greatly depend
on the manner in which matters may end at Caubul.”&mdash;On
the 21st of the same month he wrote, that he “still
adhered to his opinion, that it would be madness with such
force and means of carriage, as we could easily collect, to
attempt a fresh advance upon Caubul; and that such a
movement would only have been justified, if we had been
led to it by objects of rescue. It would be my wish, if it
could be done with safety, that Jellalabad should be retained
for some weeks, and until the fate of the British troops in
other parts of Afghanistan should be ascertained.”&mdash;On the
26th he wrote: “I agree with you that, at least so long at
the fate of the force at Caubul is uncertain, the post as
Jellalabad must be maintained. I think it will be absolutely
necessary, under any circumstances, to maintain for a
time a strong force at Peshawur&mdash;also at Quettah and
Sukkur. If our retirement carry with it a general appearance
of defeat and of flight, it will bring on Peshawur and
the Punjab&mdash;on Beloochistan and Sindh&mdash;a tide of aggression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
and disaster which it may be difficult to stem, and
against the chance of which we must endeavour to guard.”&mdash;On
the 28th, growing still more convinced of the expediency
of doing something for the recovery of our lost honour, he
wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, speaking first with reference
to the refusal of Sale and Macgregor to evacuate
Jellalabad: “We approve of the determination taken at
Jellalabad not to withdraw the troops as directed. Far from
withdrawal, under such circumstances, I am anxious to learn
that Brigadier Wild has found it safe to advance to Jellalabad....
Whatever happens beyond the passes, we
should be strong for a time in Peshawur.... For the
present, at least, Jellalabad should be firmly held;&mdash;General
Elphinstone was not in a condition to make stipulations,
except for his own troops at Caubul.”&mdash;On the 3rd of
February he expressed his opinion that Jellalabad should be
held so long as there was a chance of assisting the escape of
fugitives: “I apprehend,” he added, “that its evacuation
will, in a very short time, become absolutely necessary; if
so, the movement should not be long delayed.” He expressed
a doubt, too, whether, with the “force that we can
employ, the pass (Khybur) can be so occupied as to secure
through it a safe passage of detachments and convoys. A
descent through the Jugdulluck passes to Caubul is beyond
our present power. It would require vast exertions and
months of preparation, and in the end would be an enterprise
of no light danger. I almost conceive that it would
be an impossible enterprise with any means that we could
bring to bear upon it, unless some party should separate
from the present combination, and then with what confidence
should we render it? I have therefore, in dissent
from many for whom I have the highest respect, earnestly
wished that the force at Jellalabad could be safely and
creditably withdrawn to Peshawur.... I would not
have it hastily retire beyond Peshawur, or any healthy spot
near it.... The post should be as forward as it safely
can be; and my successor could then pursue the line of
policy which he may think best. I would not have the
government inextricably pledged to measures which my
successor may regard as rash, impolitic, and ruinous.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
he soon came to modify these opinions in favour of a forward
position; and later on the same day wrote that the disaffection
of the Sikhs might cause him to alter his views with
regard to Peshawur: “I am coming fast to the opinion,”
he said, “that our furthest point of support in advance
must be Ferozepore, and that we must bear the disgrace
and disadvantage of retiring to this frontier with as little
of loss as may now be ensured.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p>“Intelligence having been received which leaves no room to
doubt that, after the British force at Caubul had maintained its
position against overpowering numbers of insurgents for more than
six weeks, the officer commanding had judged it necessary, in consequence
of a failure of provisions, to agree to a convention of the
enemy, and to retire, in reliance on the faith of that convention,
towards Jellalabad, when the troops, exposed to the worst rigours
of cold and privation, in the mountain defiles, and harassed by
treacherous attacks, suffered extreme disasters&mdash;the Governor-General
in Council deems it proper to notify that the most active
measures have been adopted, and will be steadfastly prosecuted,
for expediting powerful reinforcements to the Afghan frontier, and
for assisting such operations as may be required in that quarter,
for the maintenance of the honour and interests of the British
Government.</p>

<p>“The ample military means at the disposal of the British Government
will be strenuously applied to these objects, so as at once to
support external operations, and to cause efficient protection for
its subjects and allies.</p>

<p>“A faithless enemy, stained by the foul crime of assassination,
has, through a failure of supplies, followed by consummate treachery,
been able to overcome a body of British troops, in a country
removed, by distance and difficulties of season, from the possibility
of succour. But the Governor-General in Council, while he most
deeply laments the loss of the brave officers and men, regards this
partial reverse only as a new occasion for displaying the stability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>

valour of the British-Indian army.</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">THE APPOINTMENT OF GENERAL POLLOCK.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 2, page 45.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">SIR JASPER NICOLLS TO LORD HILL.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I have the honour to acknowledge your Lordship’s letter of
the 13th of June, calling upon me for an explanation of the appeal
made to the General Commanding in Chief, by Major-General Sir
Joseph Thackwell, in consequence of his not being permitted to
accompany the regiment of which he is senior Colonel, on service
beyond the Indus&mdash;I beg you will apprise his Lordship, that, in
addition to the rule quoted by Sir J. Thackwell, the special appointment
of Major-General Pollock prohibited his employment in
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I shall explain the circumstances of that appointment.</p>

<p>In December, 1841, the Governor-General of India in Council instructed
me to place Major-General Lumley, of the Company’s
army, in command of the reinforcements which passed through the
Punjab in January last; and, in addition to the command of the
whole force in Afghanistan, it was his Lordship’s intention to place
in his hands the political control also.</p>

<p>Major-General Lumley’s health was such as to preclude all hope,
or even desire, that he should undertake so great a charge, and it
became necessary that I should propose another officer for this important
duty. Twice I laid before the Governor-General the name
of Major-General Sir Edmund Williams; and as a Light Infantry
officer he seemed most qualified to meet an enemy in a mountainous
country: he was active, zealous, and in perfect health. In the
command of a division he had shown a clear judgment, and given me
satisfaction.</p>

<p>I need not inform Lord Hill that the management of the native
army, or of small portions of it, is a matter, at times, of delicacy and
difficulty. It will not do to distrust or disparage it, as Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Monson did. The Governor-General gave such an unwilling and
discouraging reply to my second communication, that I clearly saw
the whole onus of the appointment and of its consequences would
be mine. This I would not undertake, and Major-General Pollock
being near at hand, and honoured by Lord Auckland’s confidence
(as I know), I ordered him by dawk to join the 9th Foot and other
corps. This done, Government was pleased to confer upon him the
political powers intended for Major-General Lumley; without
which Sir Edmund Williams would have had to act, not from
himself, but according to requisitions made by the local political
authorities&mdash;viz., Brevet-Captains Mackeson and M’Gregor. Upon
the more abstract question of the Lieutenant-Colonelcy, it must be
remarked that Sir Edmund Williams held that rank in the 9th Foot,
which gave <i>him</i> no claim to go to Afghanistan, though some officious
friend has since asserted it.</p>

<p>I had soon occasion to rejoice that Sir Edmund was not appointed
to the command on my sole responsibility, for the four sepoy corps
first sent, under Brigadier Wild, having been most sadly mismanaged
(<i>at the instance of the political authorities, against my
instructions and earnest caution</i>), when Major-General Pollock
arrived at Peshawur he found 1800 men of the four regiments in
hospital; the sepoys declaring that they would not advance again
through the Khybur Pass; the Sikh troops spreading alarm, and in
all ways encouraging and screening their desertion, which was considerable.
It was well that a cautious, cool officer of the Company’s
army should have to deal with them in such a temper, 363 miles
from our frontier. General Pollock managed them exceedingly
well, but he did not venture to enter the pass till April (two months
and a-half after Brigadier Wild’s failure), when reinforced by the
3rd Dragoons, a regiment of cavalry, a troop of horse artillery, and
other details. Lord Hill will at once perceive that the <i>morale</i> must
have been low when <i>horse artillery and cavalry</i> were required to
induce the General to advance, with confidence, through this formidable
pass. Any precipitancy on the part of a general officer
panting for fame might have had the worst effect. I must now return
to Sir J. Thackwell’s appeal. The General Order, quoted very
ingenuously by the Major-General, contains a full and complete reply
to his complaint. He was senior to Major-General Pollock, and his
proceeding with the 3rd Dragoons would have interfered with a
divisional command. He certainly did offer to serve under that
officer, but I could not recommend the government to suffer him to
do so, all such arrangements being in my opinion most faulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
principle, and, depending chiefly on good temper, dangerous. I have
since called up Sir Joseph Thackwell to my head-quarters, in order
to command the cavalry, had it been necessary (as seemed possible)
last winter to collect an army. The Major-General is in error when
he states that I intended him to command an army of observation
on the Sutlej: that post I retained for myself, aided by Lieutenant-General
Sir Robert Arbuthnot. In November next it is proposed
to collect an army of reserve in this vicinity, and Sir J. Thackwell
will have the command of the cavalry. I cannot have the smallest
objection to the Major-General’s bringing himself to Lord Hill’s
notice as he has done, except the infraction of a rule in doing so
direct. But if he had remembered that he commanded the cavalry
of Lord Keane’s army; had been twice named by me for similar
duty; has long been a Brigadier commanding a division or station;
he would have found little cause to complain of ill-fortune or
neglect. I have known many of Her Majesty’s officers, Colonels and
old Lieutenant-Colonels, to reside ten to fifteen years in India without
having had any such opportunities of service and distinction,
and, further, to command divisions without receiving the smallest
remuneration.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">Captain Macgregor’s cossids yesterday brought me the information
of your arrival at Peshawur, and of full military and
political powers in Afghanistan being vested in you. I lose no time
in sending such a view of the state of this garrison as may enable
you to form your own opinion on the necessity of moving to its relief.
Nous avons des provisionnemens pour les soldats Britanniques pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
soixante-dix jours, pour les Sipahis et les autres natifs demi-provisionnemens
pour le même temps, et pour les chevaux de la cavalerie
et l’artillerie de large pour vingt-cinq jours. Autant que
nous pouvons renvoyer nos parties pour la fourrage, nous ne
manquerons cela pour la cavalerie, mais nous serons entièrement
privé de cette ressource après le premier jour d’investissement. A
présent nous n’avons de fourrage que pour trente jours pour tous
les animaux. Les chevaux d’artillerie et les yaboos des sapeurs sont
de ce pays et mangent seulement boozeut kurlise. Nous manquons
beaucoup aussi des munitions de guerre, plomb, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When our animals can no longer be sustained by corn or forage
only, we must of course destroy them. The hospitals are ill
supplied with medicines, and much sickness may be apprehended
when the weather grows hot. At present the health of the garrison
is excellent. We have no prospect of adding to our resources above
detailed even if we had money, which we have not. The country
possesses abundance of supplies, of which the presence of a force
would give us command.</p>

<p>Mahomed Akbar is at Cherbyl, in the Lughman district, and
threatens an attack; and we may, in about fifteen days, though I
think not sooner, be invested by a large force from Caubul, with a
considerable artillery.</p>

<p class="p1">P.S.&mdash;I shall view la perte of my cavalry, should such occur,
with much sorrow, as from their successes against the enemy they
have acquired a confidence in themselves, and contempt for their
enemies, which feeling is equally participated in by the rest of the
troops. As I cannot now get an opportunity to send you a return,
I give a memorandum:&mdash;Cavalry, effective, deux cents quarante-un;
malade, vingt-un. Artillerie, effective, un cent soixante-onze;

je puis maintenir ma position dans cette ville pour le temps
que vous avez écrit; mais si une force avec les pièces (que nous
avons perdu) arriveront ici, ce sera impossible, et avant cette époque
nos chevaux moureront de faim. Il sera bien difficile et incertain
de vous donner avis de mon intention de retirer, parce qu’à ce
moment Mahomed Akbar est près avec une force de deux milles
hommes (qui s’augmente jour par jour), et à présent ses patrouilles
et videttes parcourent tout le pays.</p>

whom I am proud to recognise as a fellow-labourer in the
field of Afghan history: “P.S.&mdash;Understanding from the
3rd para. of the letter from the Adjutant-Gen. that the
authority of Major-Gen. Elphinstone has ceased, I venture
to mention to you that Captain Havelock, 13th L.I., was
appointed in general orders Persian Interpreter to the
M.-General, so long as he continued to command in Afghanistan.
He was by his permission, however, attached to me
from the period of my force leaving Caubul, and I have
received from him very valuable assistance in every way
throughout our operations, as I have already intimated in
public despatches. I trust you will pardon my undertaking
to say, that if you would be pleased to re-appoint
him to the same situation under yourself, I feel persuaded
that his local experience would render him most useful to
you. In the meantime, I have nominated him Per. Intr.

present circumstances, dispense with his services. Be good
enough to make this known also to H. E. the C. in C.”]</p>

<p><span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>*<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>*<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>*<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Since I commenced writing to you, we have been

demolished two or three of our bastions, and nearly the whole of
the parapet of the ramparts, to raise which cost the troops more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
than a couple of months of hard labour. A number of houses in
the town have been thrown down by the shock, and the small
court-yard attached to the house in which the General and myself
reside, is filled with the rubbish of a number of out-offices which
fell crashing at our feet, we having sought the centre of the yard as
a place of safety. It was with difficulty we could preserve our
footing, so great was the undulating motion of the ground we stood
upon. Our dwelling-house seemed to heave to and fro, as if it
would topple on us. I have not heard of more than two or three
persons who have been killed by the falling houses or walls.
Colonel Monteith was buried up to the neck; but he has not, I
believe, sustained any serious injury. If this town had been
seriously bombarded for a month, I don’t think it could have
suffered more than at present. God grant that we may not have to
witness anything so fearful again. I feel still giddy, although the
earthquake took place a couple of hours ago. It is to be expected
that on the enemy discovering the damage which our defences have
sustained, they will be encouraged to attack us.</p>

<p>Gold mohurs and bootkees would be of use to us, but I fear
that Mackeson would find it impracticable to send them to us in
safety.</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">THE ADVANCE FROM PESHAWUR.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 3, page 72.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">[The following is the correspondence to which reference
is made in the text.]</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Jellalabad, March 8th, 1842, 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I had the pleasure of receiving a few hours ago yours of the
26th ultimo. I must confess that its contents have deeply disappointed
me, since I gather from it that it is not your intention to
advance to my succour until you shall have been reinforced by the
brigade which you expect to reach Peshawur on the 22nd instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Now, independently of other considerations, Macgregor will inform
you that he yesterday got a Dust-i-Khat from the Shah’s Durbar at
Caubul, demanding categorically our evacuation of this place. He
referred the King and his councillors to you, and their next measure
will probably be to march an overwhelming force against us, aided
by our captured iron nine-pounders. I have reiterated in several
letters the fact that mes mains ne sont pas assez forts pour résister
tel artillerie, and therefore desire to make you once more fully
aware of the risk, if not certainty, of our being overpowered if your
advance to our support is not sufficiently prompt to anticipate this
movement of our enemies. The responsibility, therefore, of such a
result, will now rest entirely upon you, and not on me. Money is
not now of the slightest use to me, Mahomed Akbar having
established a most rigid blockade, which effectually prevents all
supplies from reaching us. Our foraging parties are also daily
attacked.</p>

<p class="pr6">Believe me to be, my dear General, yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Robert Sale, M.-G.</span></p>

<p class="p1">P.S.&mdash;As I remark that your letter does not contain any distinct
avowal of an intention of advancing even when your reinforcements
reach you, I shall be obliged, for the sake of this garrison, if you
will specifically inform me when it is probable I may calculate on
its being relieved.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p class="p2">At the same time Macgregor despatched another letter of
a similar tendency, and to this letter Pollock replied:</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">March 12th, 1842.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Macgregor</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I will write you a very short note in reference to yours and
Sale’s of the 8th. It must no doubt appear to you and Sale most
extraordinary that, with the force I have here, I do not at once
move on. God knows it has been my anxious wish to do so, but I
have been helpless. I came on ahead to Peshawur to arrange for
an advance, but was saluted with a report of 1900 sick, and a bad
feeling among the Sepoys. I visited the hospital, and endeavoured
to encourage by talking to them, but they <i>had no heart</i>. I hoped
that when the time came they would go. This, however, I could
not write to you or Sale in <i>ink</i>, either in English or French. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the 1st instant the feeling on the part of the Sepoys broke out; and
I had the mortification of knowing that the Hindoos, of four out of
five native corps, refused to advance. I immediately took measures
to sift the evil, and gradually a reaction has taken place, in the
belief that I will wait for reinforcements. This has caused me the
utmost anxiety on your account. Your situation is never out of my
thoughts; but having told you what I have, you and Sale will at
once see that necessity alone has kept me here.</p>

<p>I have sent five expresses to hurry on the first division of the
next brigade. It consists of the 3rd Dragoons, a troop of Horse
Artillery, 1st Light Cavalry, the 33rd N.I., and two companies of
the 6th N.I., all fresh and without a taint. I really believe that if
I were to attempt to move on now without the reinforcement, the
four regiments implicated would, as far as the Hindoos are concerned,
stand fast. Pray, therefore, tell me, without the least
reserve, the latest day you can hold out. If I could, I would tell
you the day when I expect reinforcements, but I cannot. I may,
however, I believe with safety say, that they will arrive by the end
of this month.</p>

<p>The case, therefore, now stands thus:&mdash;Whether I am to attempt
with my present materials to advance, and to risk the appearance
of disaffection or cowardice, which in such a case could not again
be got over, or wait the arrival of a reinforcement, which will make
all sure. This is the real state of the case. If I attempted now,
it might risk you altogether; but if you can hold out, the reinforcements
would make your relief as certain as any earthly thing
can be.</p>

<p>Our only object in going to Jellalabad is to relieve you and
bring you back with us to this; but it is necessary that this should
be kept a profound secret.</p>

<p class="p1">To this Sale replied:</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Jellalabad, 23rd March, 1842.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">Yesterday arrived yours of the 12th instant addressed jointly
to Captain Macgregor and myself. I have only, in reply thereto,
to say that in my last I informed you definitively that I would, by
God’s blessing, hold this place to the 31st instant, by which time
you acquainted me that you could arrive at Jellalabad with the
dragoons. You now state to me your expectation that they will
only reach your present encampment by that date. Our European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
soldiers are now on two-thirds of their rations of salt meat, and this
the commissariat supply; on the 4th proximo that part of the force
will then be without meat, notwithstanding every arrangement to
lessen the consumption. I have this day directed all the camels
to be destroyed, with the view of preserving the <i>boosa</i> for the horses
of the cavalry and artillery; and these valuable animals cannot
receive any rations of grain whatever after the 1st proximo, but
must be subsisted entirely on <i>boosa</i> and grass, if the latter can be

<p class="pc2 lmid">GHOLAB SINGH AND THE SIKH ARMY.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 3, page 77.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">On the 10th of February Mr. Clerk wrote to the Government
Secretary: “There seems to have been no good
reason for the delay of Rajah Gholab Singh in crossing the
Attock, unless he really feared a collision with the Nujeeb
battalions, encamped on the other side. But for the
Rajah’s apparent reluctance immediately to undertake to
co-operate in the Khybur Pass, there may be better grounds.
These may be either an apprehension of his inability to
oppose the enemy there; or, as supposed by Captain Lawrence,
a want of incentive to exertion&mdash;or both these causes
may retard his movements. In regard to the former, the
presence of the large body of British troops assembling at
Peshawur will encourage him. With respect to the latter,
I should be glad to be provided with the instructions of
government.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p>Writing again, on the 13th of February, he says: “In
regard to the means of inducing zealous co-operation on the
part of the Sikh troops, I do not think that the expectations
of Captains Mackeson and Lawrence are quite reasonable,
or the almost indefinite extent of proposed reward judicious,
or the direct negotiation with the Jummoo Rajahs for their
immediate aggrandisement honourable.... It would
not be compatible with the friendship long subsisting between
the British Government and the Lahore Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
now to assign suddenly and directly to the Jummoo Rajahs
any territories as a compensation for services demanded of
the Sikh Durbar. This would be precipitating the decline
of a power which it may be soon expedient to prop, both
against Afghans and Jummooees.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] But
though Mr. Clerk thought, at this time, that it would not
be honourable openly to treat with the Jummoo Rajahs for
the transfer of Jellalabad, he was not unwilling to place it
permanently in their hands by a stroke of <i>finesse</i>. I confess
that I cannot see very distinctly how the course suggested
by Mr. Clerk is so much more “honourable,” and “compatible
with friendship,” than that suggested by Captains
Mackeson and Lawrence.</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">POLLOCK’S APPEAL TO HIS ARMY.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 4, page 84.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">After alluding to the defence of Jellalabad, and the probability
that the Peshawur force would immediately advance
to its relief, General Pollock said: “Success in relieving
these troops will raise for this force the admiration and
gratitude of all India, and the Major-General commanding
feels assured that officers and men will cheerfully make any
sacrifices to attain so noble an object. He therefore now
calls upon the Brigadiers to assemble the commanding
officers under their orders, and determine on the least
quantity of baggage and the smallest number of camp-followers
with which their regiments can advance. The
success of this enterprise will greatly depend upon the
quantity of baggage taken, as from the nature of the country
between Peshawur and Jellalabad, the line most consistent
with safety must be as little incumbered as possible. The
Major-General commanding trusts that the confidence he
feels in the troops will be repaid by their confidence in him.
The soldiers may rest assured that his thoughts are constantly
engaged in ensuring their provisions and securing
their comforts, and they may be convinced they will never
be called upon by him to make useless sacrifices, or to
undergo unnecessary hardships. Arrangements will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
made for placing such baggage as may be left behind in
perfect security at Peshawur.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 4, pages 87, 88.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">[The following are the rules laid down for the guidance
of commanding officers, to which allusion is made in the
text.]</p>

<p class="p2">1. A bugler or trumpeter to be attached to each commanding-officer
of a party or detachment of the several
columns.</p>

<p>2. Whenever an obstacle presents itself, or accident occurs,
of a nature to impede the march of any part of either
of the columns, and occasions a break in its continuity, the
officer in command nearest to the spot will order the halt to
be sounded, which will be immediately repeated by the other
buglers, and the whole will halt till the removal of the difficulty
enables the columns to proceed in their established
order, when the signal to advance will be given.</p>

<p>3. The baggage-master will superintend the placing of the
baggage, &amp;c., in the order prescribed, and the Major-General
commanding requests that commanding-officers will use their
best exertions to facilitate this important object. The
quarter-master of each corps will see that the baggage of his
regiment is placed in its proper position in the column, and
an officer from each is to be appointed to the duty.</p>

<p>4. No private guards are to be allowed. The parties of
cavalry and infantry, allotted at intervals in the line of
march, are to be the only troops attending it.</p>

<p>5. The officers entrusted with the command of the parties
which are to flank the rear-guard on the heights, must give
their most vigilant attention to the important duty of preventing
their men from hurrying in advance of it; its rear
must never be left exposed to fire from the heights.</p>

<p>6. The troops to be told off on their regimental parades,
as above detailed, and marched at the appointed hour to
their respective posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>7. The force will march to Jumrood to-morrow morning,
in the order above prescribed. The general to beat at four,
and the assembly at five o’clock.</p>

<p>8. The baggage and camp-followers of each corps are to
be kept with their respective regiments till notice is given
by the baggage-master that they are required to take their
places in the column.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Camp Jumrood, 4th April, 1842.</p>

<p>The force to be under arms to-morrow morning at half-past three
o’clock, ready to move forward, at which time all the treasure,
ammunition, baggage, &amp;c., will be moved to the low ground to the
right front of the hills now occupied by picquets. No fires are to
be lighted on any account; no drums to beat, or bugles to be
sounded. The six companies of the 60th Regiment, and six companies
of the 33rd Regiment, will remain with the baggage, in the
vicinity of the treasure and ammunition. The parties for crowning
the heights, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor and
Major Anderson, will move forward to the hill on the right of the
pass. The parties for the same duty, under the command of Major
Huish and Lieutenant-Colonel Moseley, will in like manner move forward
to the hill on the left. Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor’s party will
be accompanied by the Irregulars who lately garrisoned Ali-Musjid.</p>

<p>Captain Ferris’s jezailchees will accompany the left advancing
party.</p>

<p>When the heights have been crowned on both hills, four companies
of the 9th Foot, the eight companies of the 26th, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor and Major Huish, also the jezailchees,
under Captain Ferris, will descend the hills to be in readiness to
enter the pass.</p>

<p>Six horse-artillery guns, four from the foot-artillery, with the
two mountain guns, will be drawn up in battery opposite the pass.</p>

<p>The advance guard, seven companies of the 30th, and seven companies
of the 53rd, will accompany the guns.</p>

<p>The whole of the cavalry will be so placed by Brigadier White,
that any attempt at an attack from the low hills on the right may
be frustrated. When the baggage, &amp;c., is directed to advance, the
same order of march will be preserved as was formerly prescribed,
with the following alteration: Six companies of the 60th N.I. will
be together on the right, and six companies of the 33rd, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 4, page 98.</i>]</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Secret Department, Benares, 21st April.</p>

<p>The Governor-General feels assured that every subject of the
British Government will peruse with the deepest interest and satisfaction
the report he now communicates of the entire defeat of the
Afghan troops, under Mahomed Akbar Khan, by the garrison of
Jellalabad.</p>

<p>That illustrious garrison, which, by its constancy in enduring
privation, and by its valour in action, has already obtained for itself
the sympathy and respect of every true soldier, has now, sallying
forth from its walls, under the command of its gallant leader,
Major-General Sir Robert Sale, thoroughly beaten in open field an
enemy of more than three times its numbers, taken the standards
of their boasted cavalry, destroyed their camp, and recaptured four
guns, which, under circumstances which can never again occur, had
during the last winter fallen into their hands.</p>

<p>The Governor-General cordially congratulates the army upon the
return of victory to its ranks. He is convinced that there, as in all
former times, it will be found, while, as at Jellalabad, the European
and Native troops mutually supporting each other, and evincing
equal discipline and valour, are led into action by officers in whom
they justly confide.</p>

<p>The Governor-General directs that the substance of this notification,
and of Major-General Sir Robert Sale’s report, be carefully
made known to all troops, and that a salute of twenty-one guns be
fired at every principal station of the army.</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">STATE OF CAUBUL AFTER ITS EVACUATION BY THE BRITISH.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VII., chapter 5, page 104, et seq.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">The letters of John Conolly written at this time afford a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
sufficiently clear insight into the state of parties at Caubul.
On the 17th of January he wrote to Macgregor: “The accounts
of our most ill-fated force become more distressing
every day. Hundreds of Sepoys, wounded, frost-bitten,
starving, and naked, come into the city. The Oosbegs buy
many, and some find their way to us, and are relieved in
the hospital, which is now crowded to excess; and the poor
wretches are dying off fast. That villain, Ameen-oollah, is
evidently anxious that the sick should die, for he will not
assist them in any way, nor attend in the least to our repeated
requests for assistance. The Newab is so completely
in the hands of the Naib that he cannot afford us any relief.
The Afghans are very sanguine in the expectation of assistance
and co-operation of the Sikhs, and talk in court of
Sultan Mahomed having received instructions from the
Durbar to do our force as much injury as possible, and that
Shere Singh has an understanding with them to prevent our
force re-entering the country. You must be aware whether
there is any foundation for these reports.... This
morning the Newab, attended by Ameen-oollah and all the
chiefs, went to pay their respects to the King in the Balla
Hissar. The King has paid two lakhs of rupees already, and
has promised one more in ten days. The Newab is Minister&mdash;Ameen-oollah,
Naib; and oaths and protestations have
been taken on the Koran that they are to be friends to each
other, and supporters of the true faith. The Newab abuses
the King most loudly and openly. The King does the same
with the whole family of the Barukzyes. Ameen-oollah
Khan has sworn eternal faith to the cause of his Majesty&mdash;bares
his head and swears most solemn oaths in the Musjids
to uphold the Newab’s dignity against the King and all the
royal family. His Majesty has sent me several messages,
saying that he submits to the extortion of the three lakhs
because he is not strong enough to oppose the demand; but
that, <i>Inshallah!</i> when he has received the salaam of the
chiefs, he will gain power daily, and be able, should our
troops come on, to play his own game with advantage to
himself and ourselves. I believe that he is heart and soul
in our interest; and it appears contrary to all reason to
suppose otherwise. The measures which obliged the Newab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
to resign his throne are, I believe&mdash;1st. The dread of our
vengeance, which the people think the King can in some
way avert, if a force is sent strong enough to shut out all
hope of opposition. 2nd. The dread of Akbar’s rising
power. 3rd. The suspicions of the fidelity of their own
party, who had shown symptoms of disaffection, and some
of whom had openly espoused the cause of his Majesty.
Such a condition cannot, I should think, last long between
such Yorks and Lancasters. There is one thing very certain,
that unless a very large force is sent up, which will
preclude all hope of opposition, every man in the country
will rise against us; and the people in the vicinity of Caubul
have so compromised themselves, and dread our vengeance
so much, that they will strain every nerve to oppose us, and
may be his Majesty will feel that his safest plan is to join his
countrymen against us. He said at the Durbar this morning
that he was glad that affairs had taken such a turn, and
that he was now able to call himself defender of the faith.
This much could not have been avoided under the circumstances....
We are amused all day long by abuse and
scurrilous verses about the Kaffirs. Books are being sold
by the weight. I have not yet been able to get hold of the
children&mdash;most exorbitant prices are demanded. The Newab
promises, but has not the power to fulfil. Salutes are being
fired, and there is a general rejoicing in honour of the coalition
between the two Kings. Artillerymen are being sent
to Akbar.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p>On the 24th of January, John Conolly wrote: “The
King holds Durbar regularly, at which all the chiefs attend.
He pretends to have shaken off all connection with our
government, but secretly sends me messages, professing all
sincerity and attachment. There is much talk of a large
force being sent to oppose the army which is said to be advancing
from Hindostan; but money is wanting; the religious
feeling against us continues very strong, and the chiefs
have compromised themselves so much, that they will rise
to a man, unless an overpowering force is sent. The Newab’s
kindness is beyond description, and he professes, and I believe
sincerely feels, great anxiety to secure the friendship
of our government. He is most deeply distressed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
treacherous conduct of the chiefs. We are quite ignorant of
the intentions of government. Mohamed Akbar is continually
writing for guns and ammunition; but not a man
can be induced to march without pay, and every one is jealous
of Akbar Khan’s rising power. The Barukzye faction
of his party view each other with great suspicion. Ameen-oollah
is the go-between. Akbar Khan is procuring all the
money he can by extortion from Sourkars and others.”&mdash;[<i>MS.
Correspondence</i>.] This was interlined invisibly on the
advice of a bill drawn by Major Pottinger on the Ferozepore
treasury, and was produced on the application of iodyne to
the paper. On the same day Lieutenant Conolly wrote to
Mr. Clerk: “The King is obliged to talk of sending troops
to oppose us at the Khybur; but he declares secretly to me
his sincerity for the British Government. The chiefs talk
of collecting an army, but the sinews of war are wanting....
Thanks to the Newab, we are safe; but it has more
than once been proposed that we should be killed....
Since our troops left this, the King has been recognised by
the Newab and the rebel chiefs on the payment of three
lakhs of rupees to the Newab and Ameen-oollah Khan.
The former is Vizier; the latter deputy. The Newab is
most anxious to serve our government. He has not been
in any way concerned in the treacherous conduct to our
troops. His kindness and attention to us is great, and he
is sincerely anxious to establish a friendship with the British
Government&mdash;being afraid of the King and Mohamed Akbar,
and disgusted with the conduct of the chiefs, who deceived
him with oaths and protestations. Great excitement prevails
in the town; the feeling against us continues very
strong, and every man will oppose our re-entering the
country, unless a force is sent which will preclude all hope
of successful opposition.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p>On the 15th of February Conolly wrote to Macgregor:
“Since my former notes, the latest of which was dated the
10th, affairs have assumed a very different aspect. Naib
Ameen-oollah, having given up the guns entrusted to his
charge, has shaken the confidence of the Barukzye party
in his (the Naib’s) sincerity, and exposed the King’s
ultimate designs of making himself strong and independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of, if not inimical to, the Newab’s clique. Yesterday the
Naib called on the Newab, on the part of his Majesty, to
send his guns to the Balla Hissar. His demand was directly
refused; and the Newab declared his determination of not
again attending the Durbar until his Majesty gave proofs of
confidence and honesty. This morning Fuzil-i-Almud, son
of Kasee Hussun, brought an order from his Majesty that I
should wait upon him; but I declined the honour in
this instance, as I had done before, feeling that no good
could come from an interview, ignorant as I am of the
intentions of government and of your wishes, and having
been, moreover, frequently warned against moving out of our
present residence. I gathered from the Kasee’s son, that his
Majesty was forming a party in opposition to the Barukzye
faction, the principal characters being Ameen-oollah, the
Populzye, many of the Kuzzilbash, and some of the Caubul
chiefs. You will perceive among his partisans the chief conspirators
in the late rebellion, Ameen-oollah, Abdool Salam,
and Sekundur,&mdash;men who have nothing to hope for at our
hands. I presume the first demand made by our government
will be the persons of these chiefs, who planned and
were most conspicuous in the late revolution; and if the information
I have alluded to be correct, his Majesty may
object to give up the chiefs. But these are matters for
future consideration; and should his Majesty be disinclined
to use his utmost endeavours for the furtherance of the
wishes of government, such unwillingness must, of course,
be regarded as hostility. It is generally believed and
asserted throughout the town, that his Majesty instigated
the late rebellion. I have never been able to prove the
accusation, though I cannot but think that his Majesty was,
directly or indirectly, the cause of the revolution. When you
know the intentions of government, you will be able to see
your way more clearly. I would, however, suggest that his
Majesty be made to understand, either from yourself or
through me, that he must either meet our wishes or go his
own road. Things are so very unsettled here just now, that
the most learned cannot foretell the events of the morrow.
All eyes are turned upon you. The evacuation of Jellalabad
will have the worst possible effect. Every one here has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
turned soldier and the people are in a high state of excitement,
and hungering after pay, which is not forthcoming.
Our host has assembled a regiment of 1000 bayonets, 1000
horsemen, some Jezailchees, and a park of twelve guns, the
ammunition for which, by the Meerza’s return yesterday,
amounted to about thirty shot, and no cartridges. There
must be some serious disturbance ere long. We are very
anxious about the sick, which we fear will be sacrificed in
any popular tumult. For ourselves, we must trust to Providence;
should things come to the worst, we shall try and
escape to your stronghold.&mdash;P.S. We have just heard that a
change of ministry has been proposed by his Majesty, and
likely to be effected, Oosman Khan to be acting premier,
and the Newab to be a sleeping partner.</p>

<p>“15th, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, 10 o’clock.&mdash;To-day there has been a noisy
debate between the Newab and Ameen-oollah, the former
abusing the latter in rather round terms. The Naib left the
room in a huff, and things are as unsettled as can be. The
Newab says he won’t give up his guns, or go to the Durbar:
and insists upon ... his Majesty pursuing the non-interference
system to which he is bound by the terms of his
treaty. There is nothing but Nifag: everybody suspects his
neighbour; everything is in capital trim for us if our army
advances; I only wait your authority to spend a little
money, and above all a guarantee to our host of a handsome
provision if he sides with us, or stands neutral&mdash;for he
is a most worthy and honest old gentleman, and had no hand
in the late melancholy occurrences. Ghoolam Mahomed
Khan has also kept aloof from the late rebellion. There is
a report that Palmer has broken up the treaty, and is again
besieged in the Balla Hissar. He writes for orders, which
kindly send with all expedition. For God’s sake beware of
Mahomed Akbar.”</p>

<p>In a letter of March 5th, the same writer says: “Futteh
Jung (Shah Soojah’s son) has gone out yesterday to join
Akbar. Things are very unsettled here still, and the Kohistanees
are fighting amongst themselves. The Newab is
still treating us with the greatest kindness. He has enlisted
about 3000 men, principally for our protection, and is
determined to fight rather than give us up. The Naib here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
has been trying to get us, and has a strong party of Sepoys
enlisted also. The Newab asked me yesterday if, when his
money is out, we shall be able to assist him, as he only has
sufficient ready cash to pay his men for one month and a half
more. Can you authorise me to make him an advance when
his money fails? For, as I said before, his entertaining troops
is almost entirely on our account. He would be safe enough
were we not his guests. In the meantime he has bought
ammunition, and got his guns ready in case of an attack.”</p>

<p>And in another letter of the same date: “The bearer
will be able to tell you all the news. I have written to you
several times, but have received no acknowledgment of my
letters. Always try solution of iodyne on my notes....
We are very kindly treated by the Newab, but close
prisoners. Ameen-oollah has tried stratagem and threats to
get us out of the Newab’s hands, with a view of screwing us;
but, thanks to the Newab, we are as yet safe, though our situation
is an unpleasant one. The King is sitting in the Balla
Hissar; but his authority is only nominal, all power being
in the hands of Ameen-oollah. Prince Futteh Jung has
started with a few horsemen towards Jellalabad, and will
probably halt for some days at Bootkak. The King sends
me occasionally messages professing sincerity for the British
Government; but he does not, in his present circumstances,
do anything which would lead his subjects to suspect his
attachment to us, or the whole population would rise up
against him.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">FROM SHAH SOOJAH TO CAPTAIN MACGREGOR.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Received January 21st, 1842.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">Let it be known to Captain Macgregor: you are aware of all that
has occurred here. Notwithstanding all I said regarding the
treachery of these men, they (the British) did not understand, but
were guided by the advice of my enemies&mdash;that is, the Barukzyes&mdash;until
arrived at this pitch. The clans of the Barukzyes had this
object, that suspicion and ill-will should exist between the British
and me. To the British they said, that I had instigated the rebellion;
and to the Mahomedans they said, that I and the Feringhees
were one, until they made me generally unpopular. Well; such
was fated! It has caused me much grief and regret. God grant
this wish of my heart, that the fate of Sir William Macnaghten and
Mr. Trevor and the other gentlemen may befall my enemies! I
frequently desired them, on the first outbreak of the rebellion, to
bring everything into the Balla Hissar, which is a place of strength.
They did not listen to my advice. I then begged them to endeavour
to gain time&mdash;that when I could arrange matters with these
men (Afghans) all would be well. During the time that I was
besieged, I expended all that I had collected with so much labour,
until I brought every one of influence over to my side by payment.
Please God they may remain faithful to me!</p>

<p>No one but myself could manage these people (Afghans) and
carry on the government. My sincerity and friendship to the East
India Company was formerly well known: at present it is as
evident to all the world as the light of day. If I had only some
treasure, that during the two or three remaining months of winter
I might strengthen myself, please God there is no one in this
country who could displace me, and, by the blessing of God, everything
would be arranged according to my desire. The men here
are not to be won without money. God grant this wish of my
heart! Before this I spent four lakhs of rupees in this affair, and I
also gave two lakhs more; I have nothing else left. If some money
could be received that I might win over these men, please God
everything could be arranged according to my desire. It is to be
hoped, as you will see, that in a few months I could collect horse
and foot so that no one could stir. God grant this wish of my
heart!</p>

<p>The bearer of this will verbally inform you of all other circumstances.
It is advisable that you should send this paper to Peshawur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
or even to the Governor-General. And send me an answer to this
speedily. Whenever you hear of the arrival of this paper at Peshawur,
be good enough to let me know, that I may feel sure of its
having passed out of this country; because the evil-disposed are
spreading reports that I am united to the Feringhees. Until I have
gained my proper footing, it is necessary that, for some time, money
should be sent to enable me to manage matters. When I have
succeeded in establishing my power, I shall not require assistance
from any one. Everything will be easy. Don’t let the men of
this country know these things. Afterwards, whatever may be
desirable for my good and for yours, God will grant. And God
grant this wish of my heart! The bearer will tell you how matters
stand. Whenever money has been received and I have reinstated
myself, I shall have these people so much under my control, that if
I order it they will carry the shoes of the Sahibs on their own
heads.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records</i>].</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">FREE TRANSLATION OF A LETTER FROM SHAH SOOJAH TO THE
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF INDIA.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Without date, brought on the 2nd of February, by a messenger fifteen
days from Caubul.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">Be it known to my friend that I am King, and know the people
well. It is right to treat people according to their deserts; some
by kindness, others by severity.</p>

<p>Some evil-disposed persons, from fear of me, took refuge with Sir
W. Macnaghten and Sir A. Burnes, and I could say nothing to
them; they stirred up strife.</p>

<p>During the last two or three years I considered the Sahibs, and
especially the Envoy, whom I valued more than my life, as my
equals; without their pleasure I did nothing.</p>

<p>It was God’s will I should see what I would have wished not to
have seen. May no other have such experiences.</p>

<p>Could it have been my wish to see my enemies and their families
in the place of my friends?</p>

<p>Once or twice I wrote to you to send a person to inquire and
inform you of the state of things in this country; but it was not
done.</p>

<p>For two or three years I consoled the people, who told me if I
was not King, they should understand it was the Feringhee; and
they (the former) told me that when I came they expelled Dost
Mahomed, but that I had disappointed them; that now their women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
left them, their country was lost; and, although at first they
received pay, even that was stopped. I could not console the
people, but I spoke of them to the Envoy, and told him that, sooner
or later, there would be a disturbance; but he listened not to me.
I told him they were deceiving him; but he believed me not, and
desired me to be at ease, for that he would settle the country with
two Pultuns (regiments).</p>

<p>He further told me to confine and expel some evil-disposed
persons. I did so; but they got access to Nizam-oo-dowlah, and
through him to the Envoy, who asked me to release them. I did
so. Now I am distressed by those very people.</p>

<p>When the Envoy was going away I asked him to take me with
him; for that I was in an extremity; I told him of what was going
on, and was not listened to. I told him that complaints were daily
made to me of Afghan women being taken to Burnes’s Moonshee,
and of their drinking wine at his house, and of women being taken
to the Chaonee (cantonments) on horseback, and of my having
myself witnessed it. When people complained to me of such things,
I asked who did so, that I might inquire; and told them not to
defame the Sahibs. I first comforted and then reproved them; and
said, if any person uses violence to your women, tell me, and inquiry
shall be made.</p>

<p>The people have often before acted as they have now; they confined
my brother Mahmood in the Balla Hissar; the conspirators
then were Mooktear-oo-dowlah and Ahmed Khan, Noorzye, &amp;c.
They pretended it was a quarrel between the Sheeahs and Soonees;
but it proved a great matter, and they saw that without me they
could not settle matters. I was then among the Kakurs. The
Khans sent for me, and all obeyed me.</p>

<p>In the present instance people said, “There are crores of rupees
in the Chaonee; let us strengthen Islam.” Such are the people.
Three or four dogs are gone (dead); as many remain.</p>

<p>Nizam-oo-dowlah was a dog and ruined all. I begged the Envoy
not to ruin the people. Nizam-oo-dowlah said to the Douranees,
the King and Envoy will destroy you. I will help you, but Captain
Trevor will not let me. The people were thus stirred up. I was
annoyed, but could not help myself; now, please God and by the
help of friends, much may be done.</p>

<p>All were against me on account of you. They sent to me to
separate myself from you, and for the sake of the faith to be King
myself (some Sahibs were then in the Balla Hissar). I did not give
a reply at the time, but sent word to the Envoy, who told me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
turn them away. I did so, saying I owed everything to the Sahibs.
They told me I would repent.</p>

<p>For some days there was fighting near the Chaonee and Balla
Hissar and Balla Boorj; at which time I sent word to the Envoy to
come with all his baggage to the Balla Hissar, where the troops
could hold out for a year or two, telling him that three or four
thousand of the inhabitants might be turned out, and guns and
stores brought. After much debate, no answer was given. I said,
“Very good! Please yourselves.”</p>

<p>Some days after I sent to the Chaonee, and warned them not to
abandon it; that I knew the designs of the enemy, who intended to
attack them; and by expending five or six lakhs of rupees I
endeavoured to bring the people from the common enemy towards
myself; but they told me to separate myself from you. On this
account three or four Barukzyes separated themselves from me;
but though I could not trust people, I managed matters by first
paying three or four lakhs, and afterwards two or three, which they
asked of me, thinking I would refuse, and they would have an
excuse for separating from me; but I gave all I had, and now am
moneyless. If, however, I had money, I could openly do much;
but nothing is to be done without money (they are dogs). If I had
money I could raise troops, and many of my old (Hindostanee)
ones who returned naked are anxious to serve me; but I have no
money. In heart I am yours, though all the world are separated
from me.</p>

<p>Nizam-oo-dowlah knew a night before it occurred what was
to happen, but did not tell me or the Envoy that we might
prevent it.</p>

<p>The conspirators told the people that I was with them; and when
the Prince went out with the troops, they (the traitors) said, “They
are with us.”</p>

<p>I sent Mahomed Sherreef to settle matters, but he was not
attended to; and he, as well as many of my troops, was killed,
which event opened the eyes of the people of Caubul; so the conspirators,
to implicate the people, attacked Sir A. Burnes.</p>

<p>If my counsel is taken much may yet be done; or, if not, I will
go to Mecca. Here the people are confirmed traitors, or I could
easily settle the whole country, and Persia and Khorassan.</p>

<p>What was fated has happened. I have not seen it in my sleep,
but have actually witnessed it. May God remove the sorrow, that
my enemies and their families should be in the place of my friends.
Is there any in the world who gave their enemies the means to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
them? The dog Akbar came as a beggar from Toorkistan. His
enmity to the Sahib-Log and myself was apparent; but lakhs of
rupees were given him to escort the troops in their retreat; and
what was the consequence? In the midst of the discussions I sent
several times to the Envoy, and asked him why he nourished his
enemy; but I was not attended to.</p>

<p>All Mussulmans turned from me on account of you; and for
three months, for your sake, I experienced trouble and distress,
and then the Envoy agreed to give the country to Mahomed Akbar,
and to allow me a lakh of rupees a year, or four lakhs in Hindostan;
but I knew and said, that as soon as they left the Chaonee they
would be destroyed; and so it has proved.</p>

<p>Between us there were no differences, and there will not be.</p>

<p>When I saw how things were going, I expended money to draw
the people from Mahomed Akbar; but now I can do nothing. I
sent news to Macgregor, and to Ghuznee, and to Candahar.</p>

<p>The road is unsafe, so I cannot write aright.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records</i>].</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">FROM SHAH SOOJAH TO CAPTAIN MACGREGOR (WRITTEN IN SECRET
BY HIS MAJESTY’S OWN HAND).</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Received February 6th.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">Let it be known to Captain Macgregor what misfortunes have
befallen me! Everything occurs contrary to expectation. I wrote,
that after labouring from earliest morning to nightfall, I had by a
thousand schemes satisfied these men and made them swear fidelity.
One came and another went; but all saying, “Be not united to the
Feringhees.” This is what the Barukzyes are spreading among the
people. I said in reply to them, “You yourselves have said that
they (the Feringhees) have done nothing for the Sirkar, and have
not fulfilled their promises; then how should the Sirkar be well
disposed towards them? During the time that I was with them I felt
that my name suffered, and I felt this disgrace&mdash;that it was known
to all the world. I continued with them until the time when Sir
William Macnaghten purposely told me to cast them (the Feringhees)
off.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> I then dismissed them, and you yourselves informed
me that they (the Feringhees) had come to an understanding
with Mahomed Akbar. How then could I still preserve any understanding
with them? Rest perfectly satisfied. At present I have
no understanding with the Feringhees.” At length, by every means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in my power, I pacified them. These men at present, whether
Barukzyes or other Afghans or Parsewans, are all obedient to me.
Without my orders they do nothing. However, I place no trust in
them. God grant that I may obtain the wish of my heart! I have
no other desire. I cannot think that you are possessed of a proper
sense of honour, since Dost Mahomed and his family remain there
with honour. Should Akbar fall into my power, if I am a Mussulman
or a man, what treatment he shall receive! Dost Mahomed
and his wives and children, in revenge for the Sahibs who have
fallen in this country, should be seen wandering in destitution
through the bazaars and streets, that it should be known to all the
world. What has been your treatment of that dog (Dost Mahomed)?
So much wealth! And what return have you received from this
faithless wretch (Mahomed Akbar)? May God accomplish this
desire of my heart! It is now some days since they (the Afghans)
have requested me to send Shumshoodeen Khan to Ghuznee.
Until to-day I have delayed. I have also made delays in the
direction of the Khybur. At length I am helpless, and if I do
not consent I shall be suspected. And from Khybur intelligence
has come that 200 men have been killed, and two loads of treasure
and two guns abandoned to the enemy, and that Mackeson Sahib
is shut up in Ali-Musjid requiring succour. If this is true, what
management! How often have I said that if I possessed money I
might collect some thousands of troops of my own! I should not
require assistance from any one. I could do anything I liked.
But I have nothing whatever. At this moment there is only
remaining two or three thousand ducats. These men, who are my
own servants, have remained with me; but, poor wretches, how
many months are they in arrears! The other Afghans I have
ordered to be mustered daily in my presence. Such as I may
select I shall continue in service. I never have had and never can
have any interest separate from yours. Alas! that you should not
have known my worth! I will delay the despatch of the men
some days longer. I shall be suspected. If I could know the
truth I would arrange accordingly. If you think that this affair
will succeed, and that an army will come, let me know the truth,
and if it is unlikely, write to me that I may make such arrangements
as shall fully satisfy you that not a cat belonging to you
shall be injured. The retreat of the Caubul Pass was quite a
different affair. All were then our mortal enemies. If I had
money I should not require assistance from any one. Since I have
no money, if the Lord (Auckland) does not think it advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
send it, I must go somewhere else. There is not another person
but myself who could manage this affair. I know these men well;
and I have not seen a man who could do anything without my permission.
Write these circumstances to the Governor-General, and tear
up this paper. What misfortunes have befallen! Write explicitly,
that arrangements may be made accordingly. They (the Afghans)
have made many petitions regarding Candahar, that an order may
be sent to the prince. It has been written and sent, carefully
worded, to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>About this affair of Mackeson, I cannot understand what management
this is. If it is true, you are destroying yourselves. I don’t
know whether there is an understanding between you and Shere
Singh that your troops should have a free passage (through the
Punjab). I wrote to Shere Singh that it was a religious war, that
he might understand. Tear up this paper; and remove from about
your person the men of this country.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Received February 8th.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">Let it be known to Captain Macgregor, I have no certain intelligence
about affairs. I don’t know what perverseness is this, that
up to the present time you will not appreciate my worth, nor
understand your own position or interests. You do not correctly
explain things to me; and if there is a prospect of your being
supported from the rear, and you have, or are likely to have, a
good understanding with Shere Singh, so that an army may come,
then I would act here as such a state of circumstances would
render expedient; but if there be no prospect of this, and you
determine on any other course, I will then take such measures as
may be desirable. May God grant the wish of my heart! I have
prayed God to grant this prayer. God is omnipotent. Write to
the Governor-General. I am not happy in this country; but if
my friends desire it, I cannot oppose myself to their wishes. The
settlement of that country can be satisfactorily managed; but the
country could never have been settled in the manner in which you
were making arrangements.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>


<p class="pc2 lmid">FROM H. M. SHAH SOOJAH TO CAPTAIN MACGREGOR.</p>

<p class="p1">Let it be known to Mr. Macgregor, to the General, and to

never entered into my imagination, it has been my lot to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
What I have already suffered, and am suffering, is known only
to God.</p>

<p>Although I frequently remonstrated, they paid no attention to my
words. These men have made fraud and deceit their trade. * * *
During the time they were committing these excesses, and would
not come in for some days, they continued plundering the shops
and exciting disturbances in the city; and in this business all the
Sirdars were concerned, and on this account the lower orders
became like hungry dogs: but God shamed them, for they got
nothing. What has happened was fated, and was owing to our own
neglect. However much I said, “Come up above; the fort is
strong; for one year no one can be brought within it; with my
servants, and from 500 to 1000 others, the fort would be strong;
and 2000 or 3000 others, with guns, sallying out might collect
grain”&mdash;[it was in vain.] However, it has passed&mdash;such was our
fate. I sent messages to cantonments, begging them not to defer
their coming from to-day to to-morrow, from to-morrow to next day&mdash;that,
please God, all would be right.</p>

<p>I had collected five or six lakhs of rupees in gold mohurs, knowing
that these people, except for money, would not act honestly,
even with God. I spent three or four lakhs of rupees amongst
them. Every tribe made oath, wrote on the Koran, and sealed;
but they still said, “The King and the Feringhees are one.” However,
I have managed to bring them thus far, and given two lakhs
more. It is a pity that I have no more money. If I had any more,
and could raise 2000 or 3000 sowars, and 2000 foot-soldiers of my
own, I would defy any one to stir. The foot-soldiers, too, who
returned from the army, I collected&mdash;300 or 400&mdash;that they might
be with my regiment. Oh! that God had never let me see this day!
Although, if money reaches me, God will prosper everything. To
give money to an enemy to collect troops, and to come and kill you,
did ever any one so trust an enemy? Even now have nothing to
say to that dog.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> This, too, I have said to you, even as I warned
you before. I am night and day absorbed in this one thought; it
has occurred to my mind that it would be better if the few ladies
and gentlemen should be brought here, in order that they might be
released from the hands of that dog. This entered my mind, and
I consulted with the Sirdars, and brought them to agree; before
this, I had sent a paper to this effect to that dog. It struck me that
that dog would not release and send them here. I then decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
that it would be judicious that Jubbar Khan should be sent. I
hope that he will bring them to this place in safety. By the blessing
of God, my mind will be at ease. No one will have power to say
anything to them; they will remain in safety. If this is approved
of by you, I will take this course; but inform me if you do not
approve of it, and can suggest anything else, that it may be
arranged. Now, men of all ranks are flocking to me. * * * I have
asked of God&mdash;if some money could be obtained all would go well,
by God’s assistance. * * * At present, my subjects make petition
to me to send money, and one of the princes with guns and an
army to Candahar. * * * I had sent for Mr. Conolly, and other
gentlemen, to consult with them, as they had themselves asked the
Sirdar to send for them; but some one said to them, “If you go to
the King he will kill you.” It was their (the Sirdars’) intention that
the King should kill them. They had sent me word secretly beforehand.
I replied, that if the world was upset, and every one my
enemy, I would not do so. They then said, that it was really true
what Jubbar Khan and Oosman Khan had said&mdash;that the King was
not separate from the Feringhees. If he is, they said, give these
(English gentlemen) to the king, that he may kill them. I heard
this, and gave them answer. They understood their position, and
repented of the step they had taken. Since this occurrence they
come and go; and I have re-assured them. They now swear and
protest that they will do nothing whatever without my wishes. If
you think it can be done, God will shame my enemies.&mdash;[<i>MS.

<p class="pc2 lmid">FROM SHAH SOOJAH TO CAPTAIN MACGREGOR.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Written in secret by the Shah himself. Received at Jellalabad on the
7th of March.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">This is the state of affairs&mdash;that night and day I am disturbed
about you. God help us! I did not wish to see such a day as this.
All day I am thinking of this. The evil-disposed Mahomed Akbar,
from the day he went to Lughman, has managed matters by the
means of the money which was given to him. From that quarter
letters arrived here (Caubul), and money was given to men who
went to join him; at length it was put a stop to, some men were
even stripped (on their way to join) in Bootkhak. At last, people
went under the plea of Gazza (religious war); by these means only
a few now go. It is nearly one month that I have delayed (sending
troops to Jellalabad): no accounts have been received (from you).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
I have made myself unpopular with all Mahomedans on your
account, and you have not comprehended it. This is an affair
affecting life. Up to this time nothing is known (of your intentions).
I know not upon what misfortunes I have fallen; and these
men are displeased with me (saying) “It is not the Shah’s wish that
we should go to Jellalabad; he wishes to destroy the true faith.”
God help us! There is no saying when those men (British troops)
will arrive. If things are thus managed, what may be expected in
Hindoostan?</p>

<p>I am altogether devoted to you&mdash;may God protect me! If they
(British troops) arrive within the next ten or fifteen days, it is well;
but if not, what ought to be done? Whatever you think advisable,
write to me plainly, that it may be well understood and arrangements
made. I am always thinking how I can obtain possession of
those gentlemen and ladies, that they may be in safety, and that
this villain (Mahomed Akbar) may not injure them.</p>

<p>I sent a message to Mahomed Shah (Ghilzye) that, if any injury
happened to them (the English prisoners), I would revenge it on
him and his family, and root out his race, and that I would seize
him. God will prosper this matter, though it is very difficult and
complicated.</p>

<p>These rascals (Afghans) make numerous oaths, and in their hearts
there is villany. May God put them to shame!</p>

<p>The true state of the case is this; if you think it will succeed,
and that they (British troops) will arrive, the sooner the better.
This is not a matter to be trifled with.</p>

<p>Shumshoodeen Khan, who went to Ghuznee, I ordered not to
press the garrison hard until I had completed an engagement
with you.</p>

<p>I have forgotten my own sorrows, and am grieving for yours.
Neither day nor night can I rest, nor think of anything else.</p>

<p>If I came myself (to Jellalabad), I could arrange the affair as I
wished. It has two advantages and one objection. I am puzzled.
God deliver me! All that has happened has been caused by want
of forethought. Now may God give me assistance!</p>

<p>I always said to Sir William Macnaghten that this affair would
end badly.</p>

<p>The day that he made arrangements for leaving (Caubul for
Bombay) I was ready to precede him, saying that I did not like the
appearance of things here. He did not listen to me. The bearer
will inform you of other particulars. What can I do? These men
are the greatest curse in the world. If I had any money I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
collect my army&mdash;then “could it be in the power of any one to
injure even a dog that belonged to you?”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="p2">The letters which Macgregor wrote in reply to the Shah
were very brief, and intended to convey as little meaning as
possible. One or two specimens will suffice:</p>


<p class="pc2 lmid">CAPTAIN MACGREGOR TO HIS MAJESTY SHAH SOOJAH.</p>

<p>Your Majesty’s letter was received by me on the 21st of January,
and I feel much honoured. The fact is, that what has occurred
was fated. It is true that they (the British) made a mistake in not
following your Majesty’s advice.</p>

<p>Please God, you may rest at ease regarding affairs here. In
this quarter there is no enemy except Mahomed Akbar, who is at
Lughman, and is the foe both of your Majesty and the British
Government. The rabble of Ghilzyes who were with him have
carried away to their homes what they were able to steal. With
the exception of 200 or 300 Barukzyes there is no one else with
him. And please God, if he comes, he will meet with a warm
reception.</p>

<p>A copy of your Majesty’s letter was immediately forwarded to
Peshawur, requesting that it might be sent with all possible haste
to the Governor-General, and that an answer might be received,
which may be soon expected. Rest at ease, that while I breathe
I will not fail to assist your Majesty to the utmost of my ability.
The army with the artillery may be considered to have arrived
near this; indeed, they will be here as soon as the distance can be
crossed.</p>

cause delay for one month, whatever may be your wish can be
arranged. Rest at ease, since the army under General Pollock,
together with the Sikh force, has arrived at Peshawur, and may be

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VIII., chapter 1, page 179, et seq.</i>]</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Candahar, April 18th, 1842.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I have been favoured with your letters of the 1st and 10th
instant. I have also heard of the affair you had with the enemy on
the 28th ultimo, and deeply regret the result. I have attentively
perused the government despatch of the 15th ultimo forwarded
through you. I have looked at our position in Afghanistan in every
point of view that my judgment, aided by three years’ experience
of its people, will admit of. I now deliberately note what I consider
to be necessary to carry out the intention of the Supreme
Government, and to assert and uphold the honour of our country,
even should the government ultimately determine on withdrawing
the British troops from the right of the Indus, it would be impossible
to retire the troops below the passes before October. The
troops at Candahar are four months in arrears, and we have not one
rupee in the treasury. In the event of much field service we should
run short of musket ammunition, and we are without medicine for
the sick and wounded. I think it absolutely necessary that a strong
brigade of 2500 men should be immediately pushed from Quettah
to Candahar with the supplies noted in the foregoing paragraph. I
therefore have to acquaint you that I will direct a brigade of three
regiments of infantry, a troop of horse artillery, with a body of
cavalry, to march from Candahar on the morning of <i>the 25th
instant</i>. This force will certainly be at Chummun, at the northern
foot of the Kojuck, on the morning of the 1st of May, and possibly
on the 30th of this month. I shall, therefore, fully rely on your
marching a brigade from Quettah, so that it may reach the southern
side of the pass on the above-mentioned date. I believe there can
be no difficulty whatever in accomplishing this, nor of crossing the
Kojuck without loss, provided the heights are properly crowned on
either side. I have crossed it three times in command of troops,
and I know that what I now state is correct. There can be no
danger in passing through Pisheen provided a careful and well-ordered
march is preserved, and patroles and flanking parties of
horse are thrown well out. The people of this country cannot withstand
our troops in the open field. I am well aware that war cannot
be made without loss, but yet, perhaps, the British troops can oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
Asiatic armies without defeat; and I feel and know that British
officers should never despair of punishing the atrocious and treacherous
conduct of a brutal enemy. You say you are not aware if I
know the localities of Quettah. I know them well and I hope
I shall be excused when I express my surprise that the authorities
at Quettah should for a moment have thought of throwing up
breastworks and entrenching that straggling and wretched cantonment,
when the town and its citadel is so well calculated for every
purpose which can render a post at all desirable in Shawl, and I am
quite certain may be well defended by 500 men. Did I command
at Quettah, I would relinquish the cantonment&mdash;it is useless.
Quettah is not a place for a large body of troops. I feel obliged to
you for pointing out the many difficulties attending our position,
but you are aware that it is our first and only duty to overcome
difficulties when the national honour and military reputation is so
deeply concerned&mdash;nothing can be accomplished without effort and
perseverance. On the last para. of your letter of the 10th instant, I
have only to observe that I have not yet contemplated falling back.
Without money I can neither pay the long arrears due to the
troops, nor procure carriage for field operations. I deeply regret
this state of things, which ought to have been attended to months
ago. Had this been done, I should now have been on my march to
Ghuznee. I shall fully rely on your brigade being at the Kojuck
on the 1st of May or before. This letter I request may be forwarded
to Major Outram.</p>

<p class="p2">[It was with no common anxiety that Nott awaited the
return of his regiments from Candahar. He had sent them
reluctantly to the Kojuck, and was eager to commence
operations in another direction&mdash;to march upon Ghuznee,
and then onward to meet Pollock at the capital. In the
letters which he addressed at this time to his brother
General at Jellalabad, his feelings found vent. They are
eminently characteristic:]</p>

<p class="phb">My last news from your side was of the 5th instant. I
regret I am not on my way to Ghuznee&mdash;I am tied to this place.
My troops have had no pay since December, 1841. I am in want
of almost everything. I have not carriage even for three regiments,
and I have not a rupee to buy or to hire cattle. For five
months I have been calling for aid from Sindh&mdash;none whatever
has been sent. At last Major-General England moved with money
and stores, but received a check in Pisheen, and then retired to
Shawl! I have now been obliged to send the best part of my force
to the Kojuck Pass, in hopes of getting the treasure and stores I
have so long been expecting, and without which my small force is
paralysed. It is dreadful to think of all this. I ought to have
been on my way to extend my hand to you from Ghuznee
instead of which I am obliged to make a movement on the Kojuck.
I have felt the want of cavalry. I have the Shah’s 1st Regiment,
but I have never been able to <i>get them to charge</i>. My Sepoys have
behaved nobly, and have licked the Afghans in every affair, even when
five times their number. The moment my brigade returns from the
Kojuck I move on Kelat-i-Ghilzye and Ghuznee, in hopes of saving
some of our officers and men at the latter place. Instead of sending
me cavalry, money, &amp;c., the authority in Sindh coolly says, “When
you retire bodily I hope to render you some assistance.” I believe
I shall go mad! I have much to say, but am confined to a slip
of paper.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">Candahar, May 6th, 1842.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">I have this day received your letter of the 14th ultimo. I
had before heard of your progress up to the 6th of April: this
is the only note I have received from you. I enclose a copy of
my note of the 29th of last month, which was sent <i>viâ</i> Kelat-i-Ghilzye,
and by which you will perceive how much I have been
disappointed, and the state of the force under my command. It
drove me almost mad to be forced to send the best part of my
force to the Kojuck Pass instead of marching towards Caubul; but
I had not a rupee to pay the long arrears of the troops, or to purchase
cattle. The people of this country unfortunately have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
idea that we are to retire whether we are successful or not, and
therefore they will part with nothing; and, as far as cattle are concerned,
we are nearly helpless. God knows why such delay has
occurred in sending me money and stores. This is dreadful. I
shall move towards Caubul the moment I can get carriage.
General England’s retrograde movement has been a sad disappointment
to me.</p>

<p class="p1">P.S.&mdash;England has now, with the aid of my brigade, crossed the
pass. He brings with him two twelve-pounder howitzers; but for
these I should not have a single howitzer at command. Mortars I
have none. I expect the troops here on the 10th. The Ghazehs
still keep head within a few miles of us, not in great strength: the
nucleus, however, exists. I have directed all camels within reach
to be procured on any terms: want of money alone prevented me
doing this earlier. The force I shall take from this must depend
upon the available cattle. I trust it may amount to 5000 men.
Rely on my making every effort to communicate with you; but
from past experience I must regard this as extremely doubtful,
and that we must not depend on mutual intelligence enabling
us to make combined movements. No opportunity shall be
lost; but if all attempts at correspondence fail, I will still hope
that, as we have one object at heart, the similarity of our operations
may in some measure supply the want of a concerted
plan.</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">GENERAL NOTT AND THE SHAH’S FIRST CAVALRY.</p>

<p class="p1">[With reference to the passage in one of the above letters,
to the effect that the Shah’s cavalry would not charge, I
have received the following letter:]</p>

<p class="pr2">Jhelum, April 28, 1852.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="phb">In the second volume of your “War in Afghanistan,”
page 447. General Sir William Nott, in a letter to General Sir
George Pollock, dated Candahar, April 29, 1842, states:</p>

<p>“I have felt the want of cavalry. I have the Shah’s 1st Regiment,
but I have never been able <i>to get them to charge</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Leeson, who commanded the regiment during my absence
on sick leave, has since died. I therefore desire, without delay, to
contradict this most extraordinary assertion. Fortunately, the
regiment has built too solid a foundation by its own gallantry to be
shaken by so malicious a representation, albeit made by a General
Officer in whose word and opinion the public and Government
placed such implicit faith; but General Nott was prejudiced against
everything and everybody in any way connected with Shah Soojah
and his country.</p>

<p>Facts are stubborn things, and I shall therefore make a few
extracts from your valuable history of the War, which of themselves
give denial to General Nott’s <i>mis-statement</i>.</p>

<p>Page 441, vol. i., states:</p>

<p>“A gallant charge of the Shah’s Horse, led by Peter Nicolson”
(who took no undistinguished part in the after events of the war),
“checked the onslaught of those desperate fanatics.”</p>

<p>In the engagement alluded to (page 591, vol. i.) at Assea Ilmee,
no mention is made of the Shah’s 1st Cavalry; but it is well known
that, under the command of Captain Leeson, aided by Lieutenant
Moorcroft of the Madras Army, who was proceeding to join his
regiment at Kelat-i-Gilzhee, and, who was a volunteer for the
occasion, the Shah’s 1st Cavalry did make a very gallant charge by
moonlight.</p>

<p>Page 603, vol. i., states:</p>

<p>“And then the Cavalry, headed by the young Prince Sufdur
Jung, who had something more than the common energy of the
Piczal race, charged with terrific effect, and utterly broke the discomfited
mass of Dooranies.”</p>

<p>It is true that the Prince did <i>accompany</i> the charge, but a
squadron of the Shah’s 1st Cavalry, under Lieutenant Crawford of
the Bombay Army, who was wounded, did nearly all the execution,
and followed in pursuit long after the Dooranie Horse under his
Royal Highness had given up the chase.</p>

<p>Page 400, vol ii., states:</p>

<p>“A party of the Shah’s Horse, under Captain Leeson, and a
detachment of Captain Wilson’s Jan Baz, who had remained true to
us in the face of strong temptation, were sent out against the
mutineers. The detachment came up with the rebels about twelve
miles from Candahar. There was a brief but sturdy conflict. The
mutineers charged in a body, but were gallantly met by Leeson’s
men, and, after a hard struggle, were broken and dispersed.”</p>

<p>I send you a copy of Captain Leeson’s report of the affair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
General Nott expressed to Captain Leeson his admiration of the
gallantry of the regiment, and his determination to recommend it
to the marked notice of Government.</p>

<p>Whatever his expressed intentions were, I have very good reason
for believing that he never fulfilled them!</p>

<p>No. 235.</p>
<p class="pr2">Candahar, 28th December, 1841.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p class="phb">I have the honour to report for the information of the Major-General
that, agreeably to his orders, I proceeded in search of the
mutineers of the 1st Jan Baz Regiment with the details as per
margin,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and, having received information on the road of a body of
horse being in the direction of Chupreal, I ordered the Afghan
Horse, who were in front, to proceed at a trot. After proceeding
three or four miles they halted, and appeared in confusion, and on
my riding to the front to learn the reason, I found they would not
obey their officers’ orders to form, in consequence of the mutineers
of whom we were in pursuit being drawn up to receive them,
amounting from 250 to 300 men, joined by about 80 footmen, who,
however, took no active part in the fight.</p>

<p>I immediately took the lead with my regiment, formed into line,
and advanced at a trot. After proceeding a little distance, my
progress was arrested by a wide ditch, through which I had to pass
my regiment by files, and which was performed most steadily. The
mutineers, seeing us advance so slowly, fancied us to be wavering
and advanced to the charge. I waited for the last files to cross the
ditch, when I charged them. The collision was severe, and the
conflict, for the time it lasted, bloody, as will be seen by the
accompanying return of killed and wounded. The struggle lasted
for about five minutes, when the mutineers broke and fled in two
bodies. I pursued that which appeared to me the largest one,
upwards of fourteen miles, cutting down the only three stragglers
we came up with, and having seen the body enter the enclosed
country on the Urghandab below Hinz-i-Muddud Khan, and having
only sixteen men with me, I gave up the chase.</p>

<p>It is impossible that men could have behaved better than those
of the 1st Cavalry. Their formations were as steadily performed as
ever I saw them done on parade, and they advanced on the foe in
as beautiful a line as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of our work was done by the sabre, not a shot being
fired on our side from either matchlock or pistol, thus proving the
confidence these men have acquired in their proper weapon.</p>

<p>I regret to say that the conduct of the 2nd Jan Baz was shameful
and cowardly. In the first instance, they refused to form when
ordered by their officer, until sheltered by my line, and afterwards,
when ordered by him to cross the water-course and join in the
attack, they refused, notwithstanding the gallant example set them
by Lieutenant Wilson, who charged, followed by his standard-bearer,
alone. He was immediately joined by several of my men,
who, seeing the precarious situation of their old adjutant, rallied
round him, and I must not omit to mention that the lives of myself
and Lieutenants Chamberlain and Wilson, who were with me, were
saved by the devotion of these gallant men, who, whenever we were
in danger, rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the main object of the mutineers to destroy the
officers, which must inevitably have been the case, had it not been
for the devotion of the men of the 1st Cavalry.</p>

<p>I have not mentioned the number of the enemy slain. I should
say they must have amounted to between fifty and sixty, for I saw
from twenty to twenty-five fall near me, and Lieutenant Wilson
reports having seen thirty to forty bodies in the direction he took.
The pursuit being immediate, there was no time to look about us,
and on my return to the field of action, there were only three
bodies remaining, which I believe to have been those of Sheeahs.</p>

<p class="pi4">Fort Adjutant, Candahar.</p>

<p>Killed: 1 sowar, 26 horses.&mdash;Wounded: 1 resaldar, 1 naib,
1 jemadar, 1 duffadar, 26 sowars, 16 horses.</p>

<p class="p1">Four months after this event, which I believe <i>was the only instance
throughout the whole war</i> where <i>both parties met at full gallop in good
earnest</i>, General Nott was pleased to say “I have never been able
<i>to get them to charge</i>.”</p>

<p>But I will adduce further proof of General Nott’s untruth.</p>

<p>Page 404, vol. ii., states:</p>

<p>“But the Cavalry, with two Horse Artillery guns, were now
slipped upon the enemy, who broke and fled in dismay.”</p>

<p>This was sixteen days after Chuplanee, and the men were mad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
be at the enemy&mdash;indeed, they would not be restrained, and no
sooner was the charge sounded than, with a terrific yell, they flew
over the plain in pursuit of an intimidated foe, who knew from
experience that they would give no quarter, and ask none.</p>

<p>We now come to the cause of General Nott’s aspersion of the
Regiment.</p>

<p>Page 416, vol. ii., most truly states:</p>

<p>“But they shrank from meeting our bayonets, and it was long
before they even ventured to come within reach of our guns. The
artillery then told with such good effect on the dense masses of the
enemy, that they were more than ever disinclined to approach us.”</p>

<p>It was on the 8th of March 1842, the day after General Nott
took the field ostensibly to war, but truly to feed his half-starved
cattle, that the enemy, who had threatened our camp on the previous
evening, were now collected in dense masses and <i>entirely
cavalry</i>. They owed the Shah’s 1st Regiment a grudge for the
lesson read to the mutinous Jan Baz, and they were determined to
pay them off. General Nott’s cavalry, consisting of 400 sabres
Shah’s 1st Cavalry, and 150 of Skinner’s Horse, certainly the aggregate
was not 600, were pushed to the front with Anderson’s twelve
guns, commanded by Captains Cooper and Turner. The country
was intersected by large, deep, wide water-courses, over which
there was great difficulty in transporting the guns. General Nott
and his Infantry were fully <i>one mile</i> in the rear, with two or three
of the nullahs alluded to between. The cavalry and guns were
halted after some cannonading at the enemy, who hovered in front
and on both flanks. Captain Saunders, of the Engineers, brought
up an order from General Nott, desiring Captain Leeson to charge
the enemy, but which body, or to which flank, was not named.
Captain Leeson’s reply was, “If I do, the enemy will possess himself
of the guns, as they will be totally unsupported.” From a mound
close at hand the enemy were seen in swarms, computed from 5000
men and upwards, and <i>all cavalry</i>. A second, and a third, and a
fourth message were brought by Lieutenant North, Bombay Engineers,
and Captains Polwhele and Waterfield, and one of them
brought word to say that General Nott had desired him to say that
if Captain Leeson would not lead the charge, he would do so
himself. Whilst this delay occurred, a party of the enemy having
seen Skinner’s Horse, under Lieutenant Travers, on the other side
of a village, determined to destroy them, and came down to the
attack. Travers flew for refuge to the guns, which had hardly
wheeled about for action. Nor had the Shah’s 1st Cavalry much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
time to form close column in rear of the guns, which were drawn
up in a curve, when a body of the Dooranie Horse charged down
with yells, brandishing their swords and waving their flags along
the ground. They were received with grape, and it was not until
several saddles had been emptied that they withdrew. This
attempt to charge the guns, <i>supported by</i> <span class="smcap">all</span> <i>General Nott’s cavalry</i>,
showed in what estimation, in their then <i>overpowering numbers</i>, the
Dooranies held the Hindostanee Horse!! Opinions were divided
as to the propriety of Captain Leeson’s refusal to charge: by many
he was censured, and by many he was praised <i>highly</i>, for having
had the <i>moral</i> courage (when from General Nott’s distance from the
scene, and the amount of responsibility which devolved upon him)
to determine not uselessly to lead a regiment to utter destruction,
<i>and not to sacrifice twelve out of General Nott’s only eighteen guns</i>!
He did all that he could do. He immediately tendered the resignation
of his command, which was not accepted. He begged for a
court of inquiry, and demanded a court martial. He attended upon
General Nott, and personally tendered resignation a second time,
and a second time it was refused, General Nott assuring him that
he was well satisfied with him, &amp;c., but that in having disobeyed
his orders to charge, <i>he had committed an error in judgment</i>. I
doubt not but that it was founded upon this event, that General
Nott wrote as he did. But surely it was no fault of the regiment.
The men had never been ordered to charge. Had they, they would
have done so most willingly!</p>

<p>Again page 423, vol. ii., states:</p>

<p>“The bright afternoon sun shed its slant rays upon the sabres
of the enemy, and lit them up like a burning forest. Our Infantry
were drawn up in a hollow square, covering a crowd of camels.
The Horse Artillery guns, which had done such good service before,
were playing gloriously, under Turner’s direction, upon the dense
bodies of the enemy’s Horse, whom their heavy fire kept at a
cautious distance; and just as General Nott, with the reinforcements,
came in sight, Lieutenant Chamberlain, of the Bengal
Service, an officer of the Shah’s Cavalry, who, at the head of a
small party, had charged the enemy, was driven back, and emerging
from a cloud of dust, formed in rear of the Infantry with the loss
of a few men killed, himself and many of his party wounded, but
not without having given very satisfactory proof of his power as a
swordsman, albeit his treacherous weapon had broken in his hand.”</p>

<p>This occurred at Baba Wullee 25th March, and everyone in the
force except General Nott was aware that the combined charge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
party of the Shah’s 1st Cavalry, and a similar party of Skinner’s
Horse, although most unnecessarily ordered by Colonel Wymer
commanding, was most gallantly executed.</p>

<p>Page 587, vol. ii., in a foot note, in a letter from General Nott to
Lieutenant Hamersley, dated June 2nd, alluding to an action
fought under the walls of Candahar, he says “a detail of the 1st
Cavalry, under Chamberlain, behaved very well indeed:” but he
never said so in his public despatch, nor did he ever allude to the
recovery by the Shah’s 1st Cavalry of the guns which Shumshoodeen
carried off after the action of Ghoine, but to which allusion is made
in page 602, vol. ii.</p>

<p>General Nott was determined that the Shah’s Cavalry never
should have any credit. He said after the action at Ghoine that
he would mention their gallantry, but that he did not do so,
everyone knows.</p>

<p>I think I have said quite sufficient to disprove General Nott’s
assertion. I do not consider it just, quietly to submit to the charge
of cowardice imputed to the regiment on the page of history.</p>

<p>The Shah’s 1st Cavalry has for some years past been transferred
into the 9th Regiment Irregular Cavalry, and the mottoes on the
standards, gallantly displayed by them, are refutations of Sir
William Nott’s assertion.</p>

<p>In proportion as your work has had an extensive circulation, so
am I desirous that this explanation should be made known; and
when your work goes through the second edition, I trust you will
make such remarks as may be an antidote to the letter which has
caused this long statement.</p>

alluded to in the text. It is important, as showing what,
in the course of my researches after truth has been emphatically

<p class="p1">“Sirdar Mahomed Akbar Khan has been with us to-day;
and from what I can learn, it seems that Shah Soojah has
entirely thrown us overboard, and is about to proceed to
open war with us; and the following appears to be the
grounds on which he wishes to treat. The agreement he
wishes us to enter into is, that if Shah Soojah, or any of Shah
Soojah’s sons in enmity to the English may send an army to
attack Jellalabad, it will thus become evident that the King
is the enemy of the English; and the English will treat him
as such&mdash;and then Sirdar Mahomed Akbar Khan will be
considered the friend of the English, who will act according
to his wishes with respect to this country, and will release
the Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan with all his family, and
send them to this country with all honour and respect, and
will restore him to his government, in the same manner as
they took it from him to give it to Shah Soojah; but will
leave to the Ameer and Sirdar Mahomed Khan the full
control of the people and government; and if any enemy
attack the government thus established, the British Government
will aid it with either money or an army, and the
friends of the one government will be the friends of the other.
The agreement which the Sirdar will enter into is this, that
he will hereafter be the friend of the English; but that at
present, to prevent himself being abused by his people, he
must proceed to close the Khybur Pass against the approach
of the English army; but he will not attempt to attack
Jellalabad before the arrival of Shah Soojah’s son and army;
and after their arrival he will use every endeavour to secretly
aid the garrison until the arrival of his father and family.”
[<i>Major Pottinger to Major Macgregor: Budeeabad, January
23, 1842. MS. Correspondence.</i>] From Major Pottinger’s
letters written about this time, his real opinion of the conduct
of Akbar Khan can only be extracted by ascertaining
the circumstances under which the different documents
were prepared&mdash;some of them having been written at the
request of the Sirdar himself. There are two letters of
January 23, one of an official tendency, quoted above&mdash;the
other of a more private and more genuine character, in
which the writer says: “He” (Akbar Khan) “sent out the
day before yesterday a Persian letter for me to send to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
in English; I wrote a letter telling you the meaning, which
he sent back to-day, and requesting me to give him an exact
copy of his own. I have done so it is true; but I fancy
his humanity was only a sham, and every sinew was strained
to destroy our poor fellows. He has, however, treated us
personally well, and very much so.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]

<p class="pc2 lmid">THE EARTHQUAKE AT BUDEEABAD.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VIII., chapter 3, page 226.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“<i>February 19.</i>&mdash;At about eleven we were visited by the
most fearful earthquake within the memory of any man in
this country. The day was beautifully clear, and nothing
indicated the approach of such a visitation. Most of us
were inside our rooms, when we heard a heavy rumbling
noise, as of thousands of heavy carriages. This was immediately
succeeded by a heaving of the earth, which caused
a rocking of the walls, and made us all rush out into the
court-yard, which we had no sooner entered than the shock,
which had ceased for an instant, again came on with a
hundred-fold violence. The high massive walls by which
we were surrounded, heaved to and fro most fearfully,
whilst we, for security, huddled together as closely as we
possibly could in the centre of the square, where there was a
deep wood-cellar. All of a sudden, there was a frightful
crash around us; and the earth heaved up and down to
such a degree that we could scarcely stand. The crash
was succeeded by a dense cloud of dust, which, for five or
six seconds, prevented our seeing the amount of injury done.
The walls of the wood-cellar fell in. The earth around us
was giving way; and we were afraid to move to the right or
left, as it would bring us within range of the walls which
were falling on both sides of us. The shock had now
expended itself. The dust cleared away. And we then saw
that our out-houses and the roof of one of our sleeping-rooms
had tumbled in. The upper parts of the walls were down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and those portions which still remained were either thrown
out of their perpendicular or had large rents in them. God
grant we may never again experience such a visitation. On
the shock ceasing, we went outside the fort, and frightful
was the devastation. The whole valley was one cloud of
dust. Almost every part had been either wholly or partially
destroyed, and great was the loss of life. Even mountains
did not escape; and fearful were the crashes of huge rocks,
as they were precipitated with awful violence to the plains
below. We had shocks at least a dozen times during the
day&mdash;but none of so alarming a nature as the first.”&mdash;[<i>Captain

<p class="phb">The astounding event of the Shah’s murder will be known
to you. These treacherous tyrants, how tyrannical has been their
act! If the Shah had not been united to the interests of the
English, and had not attended and acted according to their advice,
why should he have met with such an end, and why was he with
them until the last, save that he hoped for their co-operation?
They placed that ungrateful man, the Nizam-oo-dowlah (Oosman
Khan), in power, and, by their acting according to his advice,
matters came to such a pass. The Shah was aware of the treachery
and disaffection of these persons, and how much soever he warned
the English of this, it was of no use. It was because the Shah
looked upon himself and the English as one, and attended to their
pleasure, that the revolution took place; but this is known to you.

deputies with it to the Shah, stating that, if the Shah would
forsake the English and ally himself to Islam, they would acknowledge
him as their King. The Shah replied: “They and I are one;
I am not separated from them.” These bastards united and proclaimed
the Shah an infidel. The Shah told the English to leave
the cantonments and enter the Balla Hissar. The English did not
consent to this. The Shah then endeavoured to conciliate the
rebels, and night and day took oaths with them, with the view of
carrying out the plans of the English. After the English left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
cantonments, the people tendered to the Shah their submission,
and endeavoured to persuade the King to attack Jellalabad. The
Shah, by a thousand devices, managed for two and a half months
to put them off, in order that the British reinforcements might
reach you. All the money that the Shah possessed he gave to the
people. The people gave out that as the Shah would not go to
Jellalabad, it was evident that he was friendly to the (British)
infidels; he and they were one. The Shah felt embarrassed. He
said to his confidential servants: “If I go to Jellalabad, lakhs of
people would collect, and I should be unable to control them, and
if by this time the British reinforcements had not arrived, it would
be bad for the cause.” The King, not knowing that the reinforcements
had arrived, agreed to leave the city, but determined not to
reach Jellalabad for twenty days&mdash;500,000 registered troops&mdash;and
if he saw that it was to their advantage, he would join the British.
On the 22nd Suffur (5th of April), the Shah’s murder took place; on
the 23rd Suffur, the Populzye nobles, and Ameen-oollah Khan,
Loghuree, placed me on the throne. Even as the Shah was the
friend and well-wisher of the English, so am I the friend and well-wisher
of the English. On account of this friendship the King
sacrificed his life and property. Had he accepted the friendship of
the Mussulmans, the Shah would neither have been proclaimed an
infidel, nor have thus met with his death from the hands of the
Barukzyes. I am not pleased at having been placed on the throne
by these people. If God places me on the throne, and if this
country is again in the possession of the British, and they support
me on the throne and in getting my revenge from these tyrants
who killed the Shah, then I shall be pleased. The Shah sacrificed
his life and property on account of the English, and now it is for
them to uphold the reputation of his family. If in a few days
your army does not arrive at Caubul, they will carry off the Shah’s
family. Write speedily, and tell me what I am to do, and what
the family of the Shah is to do. It is necessary that the British
should arrive soon. The death of the Shah has caused disunion
among the chiefs. It is necessary that your army, with a large
army of the Sikhs (God willing), should advance. When I was first
placed on the throne, the people were considering the death of the
Barukzyes, but on hearing that your army had arrived at Jellalabad,
and that Mahomed Akbar had been defeated, the people agreed
to suspend hostilities among us, and endeavoured to induce me to
attack Jellalabad. Up to the present time this is what they are
striving to effect, but I tell them, that if they will in the first place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
avenge the Shah’s death, then I’ll go to Jellalabad. But I am
powerless, and shall anxiously expect a letter from you. Tell me
how to act. To defeat this people is at present very easy, for great
is their disunion. Start soon for Caubul.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">DEFEAT OF THE NEWAB ZEMAUN KHAN.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book VIII., chapter 5, page 277.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“The reason of the overthrow of the Newab is the disaffection
of some of the most influential men of his party&mdash;the
chief one being Oosman Khan, who was bought over
with 1000 gold mohurs. The Pultuns also went over, and
our host (Meer Hadjee) was bribed with 4000 gold mohurs,
and during the fight his brother, Mahomed Dost, took an
active part against the Newab. Poor old Zemaun Khan
was a dupe throughout to Hotspur’s (Akbar Khan’s) perfidy,
and a victim to misplaced confidence.”&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant John
Conolly to Captain Macgregor: Caubul, June 23, 1842.
MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p>Akbar Khan’s own account of the affair, and of his subsequent
treatment of Zemaun Khan, is on record in the
following letter to the Shinwarree chiefs: “Up to the day
of writing this, the 17th of Jamadi-ul-aroal (26th July), all
is well here with me. As it was an object of paramount
importance that in the contest with the race of misguided
infidels the whole of the numbers of the true faith should
be united together, and the attainment and perfecting of
this object appeared indispensable, therefore did the whole
of the devoted followers of the true faith consent to choose
me as their head, and to place themselves under my command.
All the tribes and leaders of the Douranees,
Ghilzyes, and Kuzzilbashes and Kakulees and Kohistanees,
have submitted to me, and I have placed on the throne the
King, high in power, majestic as Alexander, ambitious as
Kai-Khusro, Shah-zadah Futteh Jung, son of the late King,
and caused the Khutba to be read and coin to be struck in
his name, redoubted as that of Faridoon. Newab Mahomed
Zemaun Khan, having in some respects opposed himself to my
views and interfered with me, at length came to an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
rupture, and commenced hostilities against me. After
several of my people had been killed and wounded, then,
and not till then, I, of necessity, gave the order to them to
retaliate. In two hours the engagement was at an end;
and all order being destroyed among the troops of the
Newab, they were dispersed. His guns and magazines,
stores and horses, and regiments and jezailchees, and other
appendages of power which he had newly prepared, all fell
into my possession. As the Newab was a part and parcel
of myself&mdash;not wishing to reduce him to a state of poverty
and want&mdash;I, on the same day, restored to him all his
horses: the rest of his property I kept possession of. Since
then, all the leaders of the different tribes have acknowledged
my authority, and I firmly trust that all my future
undertakings will in like manner be crowned with success,
and that the object nearest the hearts of me and you, and
all the race of Islam&mdash;viz., the extermination, root and
branch, of the detested race of infidels, may be without
difficulty accomplished. Set your mind perfectly at rest on
this subject, and do not entertain any misgivings, and gird
up your loins for action, and be ready with the fear-inspiring
and punishment-inflicting Ghazees, and use your utmost
exertions and efforts to close the Khybur road and intercept
their dawk communications, that their messengers may not
pass to and fro, and that no grain may reach them from any
quarter; for this is the real way to defeat this misguided
and detested race,&mdash;this is the real battle of martyrdom
which you must fight: therefore consider this injunction
as of the very first importance. In a short time, by the
favour of God the Almighty, and the assistance of the
founders of our religion, this humble servant of God, with a
terror-inspiring army from this country, and an artillery
thundering and flashing fire, and with jezailchees threatening
like Mars, and with artillerymen like Saturn, and Ghazees,
who march hand-in-hand with victory, will set out for your
direction: and if it be the will of God, will soon clear the
surface of that country, sweeping from it the rubbish from
the bodies of the enemies of our religion. Meanwhile it
behoves you, in anticipation of the arrival of the exalted
standards, the emblems of victory, to spare no exertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
to stir up the strife of religion, and send me constantly
news of your welfare, and of the movements of the vile
infidels, that according to your information I may take
measures to counteract them. Futteh Mahomed, the son of
Saadat Khan, is here, and will shortly leave me to join you
with the Ghazees.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">LORD ELLENBOROUGH AND SIR JASPER NICOLLS.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book IX., chapter 1, page 286.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">It was not until the 27th of August that the Commander-in-Chief
was informed, by a letter from General Pollock, of
the instructions sent to General Nott on the 4th of July.
How entirely the Governor-General had set aside the authority
of the Commander-in-Chief, and what Sir Jasper
Nicolls thought both of Lord Ellenborough’s conduct and
of the advance on Caubul, may be gathered from the following
extracts from his journal:</p>

<p>“<i>June 6.</i>&mdash;To my astonishment, Lord E., in consequence
of General Pollock’s complaints of want of carriage, has
consented to his remaining beyond the Khybur till October,
though he quotes the Duke of Wellington’s dictum, that
an army, which cannot be moved as you will, is no army at
all. He will thus have an unhealthy, difficult pass behind
him for four or five months, and possibly involve us in
another dreadful campaign. These changes are dreadful. I
wish that I had nothing to do with them.”</p>

<p>“<i>June 30.</i>&mdash;The Secret Committee review the proceedings
of Government, from December to February last, not with
asperity, but with decided disapprobation of the uncertain
policy of that time, and the contradictory resolutions and
orders which were then passed. This is very well deserved,
for it was then, in November or December, that Government
ought to have decided to leave the country or to
resume our full control over it.”</p>

<p>“<i>August 8.</i>&mdash;The wants of General Pollock’s army are put
down at 6½ lakhs <i>per mensem</i>, and we are just going to send
20 to clear him off&mdash;the last, I believe and hope, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
shall send to be buried in the Punjab and Afghanistan.
Twenty-one lakhs he had before.”</p>

<p>“<i>August 15.</i>&mdash;General Nott has fixed on the 2nd of this
month for leaving Candahar, and in two divisions&mdash;the
Bombay troops by Quettah and Sukkur&mdash;the Bengal column
by Dehra Ismael Khan. This is quite new to me, and
may be either ordered by the General or suggested by
Lord E.”</p>

<p>“<i>August 20.</i>&mdash;This order as to retirement by Dehra
Ismael Khan appears the effect of impulse. Its neglect of
me I forgive, though a manifest slight; but I do not find
that he has ordered the necessary supplies to be collected for
the retreat through the Sikh territory, which is, in parts
near that place, almost a desert.”</p>

<p>“<i>August 24.</i>&mdash;The 3rd Dragoons, and another troop of
horse artillery, are about to join Sir R. Sale at Futtehabad.
Can the General be now organising an advance on Caubul?
Is he commanded to do so? Can he effect it? Is he to
encamp at Gundamuck till Nott’s attack on Ghuznee (if that
take place)? It is curious that I should have to ask myself
these questions; but so it is. I am wholly ignorant of the
intended movements of either. Lord Ellenborough means to
surprise friend and foe equally.”</p>

<p>“<i>August 27.</i>&mdash;<i>To-day</i> I find, by a despatch from General
Pollock, that General Nott has decided on returning to the
provinces, <i>viâ</i> Ghuznee and Caubul. Lord E., by letter dated
4th of July, gave him a choice as to the line by which to
withdraw, and he has chosen this&mdash;certainly the noblest and
the worthiest; but whether it will release our prisoners and
add to our fame, I cannot venture to predict. Lord E.’s
want of decent attention to my position is inexcusable.”&mdash;[<i>Sir
Jasper Nicolls’ MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">THE GHUZNEE PRISONERS.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">[<i>Book IX., chapter 3, page 349.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">I have stated in a note that the Caubul prisoners, before
their removal to Bameean, had been joined by their fellow-captives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
from Ghuznee. Some idea of the sufferings of the
latter may be derived from the following passages of Lieutenant
Crawford’s Narrative: “Every little thing we had
managed to secure, such as watches, penknives, money, &amp;c.,
was taken from us, and we were strictly confined to a small
room, eighteen feet by thirteen. In it there were ten of us.
* * *  When we lay down at night we exactly occupied
the whole floor; and when we wanted to take a little exercise
we were obliged to walk up and down (six paces) by
turns. Few of us had a change of linen, and the consequence
was we were soon swarming with vermin, the
catching of which afforded us an hour’s employment every
morning. I wore my solitary shirt for five weeks, till it
became literally black and rotten. * * * On the 7th of
April we heard of Shah Soojah’s death, and from that date
the severities of our confinement were redoubled. They
shut and darkened the solitary window from which we had
hitherto derived light and air, and they also kept the door
of our room constantly closed, so that the air we breathed
became perfectly pestiferous. On the 21st of the month
they tortured Colonel Palmer with a tent-peg and rope in
such a manner that it is wonderful he ever recovered the
use of his foot. I cannot in a letter explain the process of
the torture, but we all witnessed it, and it was something
on the principle of the Scotch boot described in ‘Old Mortality.’
* * * In the end of April our guards suddenly
became particularly civil to us for a few days, and we found
that they had a report of the advance of our troops. * * *
On the 12th of May we were permitted to quit our prison-room,
and walk on the terrace of the citadel for one hour.
* * * Just at this period (June 15) one of our number,
Lieutenant Davis, 27th N. I., had sickened with typhus
fever. We had no medicines, no comforts for him, and he
lay on the ground delirious, raving about home and his
family, and every hour proving worse, till, on the 19th,
death put an end to his sufferings. We read the burial
service, and then made his body over to the guard to bury;
but I am afraid they merely flung the poor fellow into a
ditch outside the gate. On the following day we were
removed to another building, where we had three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
rooms to ourselves, and a court-yard to walk about in.
This was a delightful change. From this date the conduct
of Shumshoodeen towards us improved greatly. * * * It
was on the 19th of August, we had, as usual, wrapped
ourselves up in our cloaks, and taken lodgings on the cold
ground for the night, when the chief suddenly entered the
yard, and told us we were to march immediately for Caubul;
and sure enough in half an hour we found ourselves moving
towards the capital. * * * We went direct to Mahomed
Akbar’s quarters in the Balla Hissar, and from him we met
with the kindest reception. He bade us be of good cheer,
as our future comfort would be his care, and we should find
ourselves treated like officers and gentlemen. * * * We
found our countrymen living in what appeared to us a small
paradise. They had comfortable quarters, servants, money,
and no little baggage, and a beautiful garden to walk in.”</p>

and sustained loss of life and

To-day, the 15th of Shau Bau

Just now news has reached us

No army ever moved with fewer instances of plunder than

occurred without punishment being inflicted. The persons who
had made this complaint ought to be made to prove the truth of
what they say. I believe the enemy (I mean Futteh Jung’s party

under Major-General M’Caskill, to disperse the followers of
Ameen-oollah Khan and Mahomed Akbar, and to endeavour
to secure the person of the latter. Futteh Jung continued
for several days in power, and appeared disposed to endeavour
to retain it. The hope which then existed, that
Mahomed Akbar Khan would fall into our hands, no doubt
had great influence with him; but when this hope vanished,
the representations of his female relations, and the remembrance
of the gross treachery he had experienced from the
chiefs on former occasions, appear to have alarmed him;
and at length he announced to me his determination to
accompany the British troops to Hindostan. At the same
time I received a letter, a translation of which I have now
the honour to forward, from Gholam Mahomed Khan (the
minister) and Khan Shereen Khan, the chief of the Kuzzilbashes,
on the part of several other chiefs, avowing their
determination to support the brother of Futteh Jung (Shahpoor)
on the throne of Caubul. It was long before I could
convince the chiefs comprising this party that they could
not hope for any assistance from the British Government,
either in money or troops; but as they still persisted in
urging me to allow the Prince Shahpoor to remain, and as
he repeatedly assured me he was anxious to do so, I did not
conceive myself authorised by my instructions to remove
him forcibly from Caubul, and only stipulated that the
British Government should not be supposed to have raised
him to the throne. On the morning of the 12th of October,
after the British troops had marched from Caubul, Prince
Shahpoor was put on the throne, and the chiefs took the
oaths of fidelity to him.”&mdash;[<i>General Pollock to Lord Ellenborough:

object of creating a sensation; but I confess that if individual and
isolated instances of excess had occurred, I should not have been
much surprised, composed, as all India armies are, of such a heterogeneous
mass, comprising all classes and castes; more than two-thirds
of whom are either public or private servants and adventurers,
who, though nominally following some occupation useful to an
army, proceed with it for the sole purpose of plundering when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
favourable opportunity offers. Some excesses may, unknown to me,
have been committed; but I will venture to assert that no troops
ever conducted themselves with more forbearance under such
unprecedented aggravations: perhaps no army was ever placed in a
more trying situation.</p>

<p>During the whole course of their progress towards the capital
they had ocular proofs of the treachery and brutality of a merciless
enemy; but still I am unable to call to mind any wanton, deliberate
act of inhumanity on the part of the troops; and cannot but regret
that the culpable instances alluded to have not been specified, as I
may possibly be suspected of suppressing facts. This, however, I
beg to assure your Lordship I have no wish to do.</p>

<p>The feeling of the Hindoos against the Afghans was very
naturally strong, in consequence of the latter having deprived the
Hindoos of their caste whenever they came into their power; but
no troops could feel otherwise than excited at the sight of the
skeletons of their late brethren in arms, which still lie covering the
road from Gundamuck to Caubul; and as if the more to rouse a
spirit of revenge, the barricade at Jugdulluck was literally covered
with skeletons.</p>

<p>What I have stated above will not be considered as justifying
excesses on the part of a British army; but it may be admitted in
extenuation of individual cases.</p>

<p>A few days previous to the march of the brigade under Brigadier
Monteith, an European was murdered by the Afghans at Jellalabad.
The destruction of Alli Boghan by some men under Brigadier
Monteith’s command, was caused by one of those sudden bursts of
feeling which, being wholly unexpected, no precautions were
deemed necessary; but it was a solitary instance, and occurred
nearly as follows:&mdash;Some camp followers entered the village, and
having found parts of the dress of some of our soldiers who had been
massacred on the march from Caubul, a number of men proceeded
to the village, which was eventually burnt, whether accidentally or
intentionally is doubtful; so very soon was the mischief perpetrated,
that the Brigadier was hardly aware of it till the place was in
flames. He immediately took measures to prevent a recurrence of
such scenes, and I wrote in strong terms on the subject. Subsequent
to that event, during the whole time the Brigadier was detached, I
heard of no more excesses. In the instance of Alli Boghan, after a
most minute inquiry, I have reason to believe that not a man,
woman, or child was injured, and I know the greater part of the
property was returned to the head man of the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>In subsequent engagements with the enemy at Mamookail,
Jugdulluck, and Tezeen, I neither saw or heard of any excesses.
A report was circulated that an European was burnt alive at
Jugdulluck, and that two Afghans were burnt in like manner by
our troops in revenge, the whole of which was an infamous
fabrication.</p>

<p>I know of no instances of cruelty or excess at Istaliff; and the
feeling of the army could not have been very prone thereto when
about four or five hundred women and children were protected
from insult and injury, and made over to their families after the
engagement. If any excess has been committed which I have not
noticed, I can only affirm that I recollect none; and I beg to add,
that the praise bestowed on the troops on a late occasion by your
Lordship for their “forbearance in victory,” is, as far as I am able
to judge, well merited; and I trust your Lordship will never have
cause to alter your good opinion of their conduct.</p>

<p>On the subject of trees being destroyed, I am unable to call to
recollection what occurred in Brigadier Monteith’s detachment;
and the only instance of their destruction, which came under my
personal observation, was at Mamookail, where the ground was
such that I was obliged to encamp the different regiments in the
gardens surrounding the fort. Without this precaution I should
have been subjecting the troops to constant annoyance, as the enemy
would certainly have occupied them. The destruction of the vines
and other small plants was almost a necessary consequence of our
occupying Mamookail.</p>

<p>With regard to the destruction of the Caubul bazaar and mosque,
it may possibly be supposed that with them was destroyed other
property; but this was not the case.</p>

<p>The insult offered to the remains of the late Envoy was notorious
to the whole of the chiefs and inhabitants of the city. They
admitted that the mutilated body was dragged through the
bazaar and treated by the populace with every indignity, and
eventually hung there, that every Afghan in the city might witness
the treatment of the remains of the representative of the
British Government. The intended measure was communicated
to the chiefs, who not only admitted the propriety of destroying
a place were such scenes had transpired, but offered to, and did,
accompany the party sent for its destruction. Those who resided
at and near the bazaar had two days’ previous notice to remove
their property (which they did), and I am not aware of any instances
of violence having occurred. It was not possible entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
to prevent plundering; but during the time the engineer was employed
in the destruction of the bazaar and mosque attached, both
cavalry and infantry were on duty in the city to prevent any
outrage.</p>

<p class="phb">Since I had the honour to address your Lordship on the
2nd instant, in reply to your Lordship’s letter dated the 23rd
ultimo, it has occured to me that I could not produce better
proof of the forbearance of the troops under my command than
by a reference to their conduct on the morning of the 16th of
September last. I have already officially detailed the number of
troops which accompanied me on the occasion of planting the
colours on the Balla Hissar. It was deemed advisable on that occasion
to go through a part of the city, and although the troops
had arrived only the day before from a march which was abundantly
calculated to irritate and exasperate them, they so fully and
literally obeyed the orders I had previously given, that not a
house or an individual was injured, either in going or returning
from the Balla-Hissar. The destruction of the residence of Koda
Bux, the chief of Teezeen, may perhaps have been considered an
excess; I will therefore explain, that during the time the army
remained in advance of Teezeen, the chief of that place was the
cause of our communication being cut off. He was repeatedly
warned what the consequences would be when an opportunity offered,
if he persisted in such a course; but I beg to add that the
injury sustained by the chief in the destruction of his residence
entailed no loss on others that I am aware of, as the injury done
was confined almost entirely to the fortified dwelling. Forage was
found there and brought to camp, but not an individual was injured.</p>

<p class="pr2">Dinapore, <i>18th April, 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p class="phb">I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated the 29th ult., which awaited my arrival here. I regret that I
was not sooner in possession of your letter, as I fear this will be too
late for the purpose required. Nearly all the information it is in
my power to give is contained in the accompanying copies of letters
which I have addressed to the Right Honourable the Governor-General
in reply to a reference his Lordship was pleased to make to
me. With respect to the extent of injury done by the brigade
under Brigadier Monteith, I am unable to give any detailed account.
The provisions, grain, etc., and materials for building, were taken
from those of the inhabitants who were openly opposed to our
troops; but in both cases the cost of things taken was carried to the
account of government. I have already, in my letters to his Lordship,
stated that I am not aware of any Afghans having been killed
when unresisting, or from any feeling of revenge on the part of the
troops. Torabauz Khan, the chief of Lallpoora, and the governor
of Jellalabad, accompanied the brigade to point out what property
should be respected. With regard to the violation of woman, I
heard of no instance of the kind; and I am quite sure that Brigadier
Monteith would have done his utmost to prevent such excuses. I
have stated to his Lordship what occurred at Mamoo Kail, and I
know most positively that no Afghan was killed on that occasion
except in fair fighting. The families had, I believe, gone the day
before the place was taken. I cannot say when or by whom the
fort or adjoining houses were set fire to. I passed through with
the right column in pursuit of the enemy, and did not return till
the afternoon, when I had determined to encamp there. On my
return I found Brigadier Pollock with his column (the left) occupying
the gardens. The fort and adjacent houses were still
burning. On the return of the whole of the troops, it was necessary
for their security to take advantage of the gardens surrounded by
walls, and the men were accordingly encamped there. The destruction
of the vines was a necessary consequence, as every one must
know who has seen how grapes are cultivated in Afghanistan.
There were very few trees cut down, but the bark of a number of
them was taken from about two or three inches. With reference to
the third paragraph of your letter, I beg to state, that from the date
of my arrival at Caubul on the 15th of September, the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
commenced returning to their houses. They had assurances from
me of protection, and, with the exception of the covered bazaar, I
did my utmost to protect both the inhabitants and their dwellings
from injury. I have already stated to his Lordship why I considered
that particular spot (the bazaar) should suffer, and on the 9th of
October the engineer commenced his operations. I believe I am
quite justified in stating that no lives were lost; the private property
had been removed, and I had both cavalry and infantry on
duty in the city to prevent plundering. Some injury was no doubt
sustained by the city, but the damage done even when we left it
was partial and comparatively trivial. I consider it mere justice to
the troops who proceeded under my command to Caubul, and who
passed over scenes which were particularly calculated to cause
great excitement among them, to state, that their conduct on proceeding
to the Balla Hissar (passing through a part of the city)
was quite unexceptionable, and the good effect resulting therefrom
was immediately felt: confidence was restored; in proof of
which I may state that supplies both of grain and forage were
brought in abundantly, everything being paid for. I have no
memorandum from which to quote the exact quantities of grain
which came into camp, but my recollection of the quantities in
round numbers is as follows:&mdash;The first day 500 maunds, second
day 1000 maunds, third day 1600 maunds, fourth day 2000
maunds, fifth day 1000 maunds. The falling off of the supplies
on the fifth day was the consequence, I was told, of some of the
men of General Nott’s force having plundered those who were
bringing in supplies. I wrote to General Nott on the subject;
but from that period the supplies never came in so freely as
before, and I am sorry to add that many complaints were made.
I have hitherto been silent on this subject, and should have
continued so, for reasons which it is perhaps unnecessary to explain;
but as the third paragraph of your letter calls for a more
particular report than I have hitherto made, I reluctantly forward
the accompanying documents, upon which it is unnecessary for
me to make any comments.</p>

<p>I beg, however, to state distinctly, that until plundering commenced
supplies of every description were abundant, and the
people were fast returning to the city. In reply to that part of
the third paragraph in which I am directed to state what injury I
understood had been committed by the Candahar force after my
march, I have merely to observe, that from all I had heard I
thought it advisable that the whole force should move from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
Caubul the same day; and this precaution, I have reason to believe,
prevented some excesses.</p>

<p>In reply to the fourth paragraph, I believe I may with great
truth state that no Afghans were destroyed in cold blood, either
before or after reaching Caubul. No women were either dishonoured
or murdered, that I am aware of. With regard to the
destruction of that particular part of the Caubul bazaar where the
envoy’s remains were treated with indignity, and brutally dragged
through to be there dishonoured and spit upon by every Mussulman,
I admit that I considered it the most suitable place in which
to have decided proofs of the power of the British army, without
impeaching its humanity.</p>

<p>I have, as directed by you, forwarded a copy of this letter and
the original documents to Colonel Stewart, for the information of
the Governor-General.</p>

<p class="pr2">London, <i>2nd April, 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">The Secret Committee has communicated to us the letters noted
below,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> relating to inquiries addressed by order of the Governor-General
to the General Officers lately commanding in Afghanistan,
on the subject of certain rumours of outrages alleged to have been
perpetrated by the British troops, and conveying replies to those
inquiries from Major-Generals Sir George Pollock, Sir William
Nott,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> and Sir John M’Caskill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>When these rumours were first brought to our knowledge, we
deemed them to be great exaggerations, if not altogether unfounded;
and we did not doubt that we should receive, in due
course, full and exculpatory explanations as to what had actually
taken place.</p>

<p>Whilst we regard the statements made by the three General
Officers as generally satisfactory, we cannot avoid the expression
of our regret that Sir William Nott should have been hurried,
by the warmth of his feelings, into throwing on the government
which he served the reflection contained in the last paragraph of
that letter, and which was quite unnecessary to the vindication of
his own character, and that of the troops under his command.</p>

<p>Neither can we do otherwise than notice with regret the publication
of Sir William Nott’s letter in an English newspaper. We
have not the means of ascertaining how this irregularity occurred,
but we must observe, that unauthorised disclosure of official correspondence
on any subject is highly improper, and may lead to
the greatest inconvenience.</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">“A map of this kind brings before us such a picture of the surface of a given
country as no ordinary map could ever do. To the mind’s eye of the average
Englishman, India consists of ‘the plains’ and ‘the hills,’ chiefly of the former,
the hills being limited to the Himalayas and the Nilgiris. The new map will at
least enable him to correct his notions of Indian geography. It combines the
usual features of a good plain map of the country on a scale of 150 miles to the
inch, with a faithful representation of all the uneven surfaces, modelled on a scale
thirty-two times the horizontal one; thus bringing out into clear relief the comparative
heights and outlines of all the hill-ranges, and showing broad tracts of
uneven ground, of intermingled hill and valley, which a common map of the
same size would hardly indicate, except to a very practised eye. The plains of
Upper India are reduced to their true proportions; the Central Provinces,
Malwa, and Western Bengal reveal their actual ruggedness at a glance; and
Southern India, from the Vindhyas to Cape Comorin, proclaims its real height
above the sea-level. To the historical as well as the geographical student such a
map is an obvious and important aid in tracing the course of past campaigns, in
realising the conditions under which successive races carried their arms or settlements
through the Peninsula, and in comprehending the difference of race, climate,
and physical surroundings which make up our Indian Empire. Set in a neat
frame of maplewood, the map seems to attract the eye like a prettily-coloured
picture, and its price, a guinea, should place it within the reach of all who care to
combine the useful with the ornamental.”&mdash;<i>Home News.</i></p>

 About the same time Lord Auckland wrote to Sir W. Macnaghten:
“I would have you share in the feeling which is growing strongly upon
me that the maintenance of the position, which we have attempted to
establish in Afghanistan, is no longer to be looked to. It will be for
you and for this government to consider in what manner all that belongs
to India may be most immediately and most honourably withdrawn
from the country.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

Mr. George Clerk at that time entertained very similar opinions
regarding the danger of sending more regiments away from the North-Western
Provinces. “Whatever may take place,” he wrote to Lord
Auckland on the 25th of November, “in regard to Caubul, and in
whatever degree our troops there may be reinforced, we should not
weaken this frontier. Any reduction of our military strength causes
some presumption or audacity in our native allies generally.” And on
the 29th he wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western
Provinces (Mr. Robertson): “I really do not see how our muster-roll
is to stand this draining of more troops&mdash;and probably many more,
west&mdash;whilst reinforcements are also proceeding eastward. Undoubtedly
the remainder will be inadequate to the due maintenance of our high
supremacy in India.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>] There was, unquestionably,
a choice of evils at this time. But Sir Jasper Nicolls and
Mr. George Clerk differed in opinion as to which was the greater of the
two.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a></span>
 On the 27th of November he wrote to Lord Auckland from Mynpoorie:
“If it be decided that we are to support Shah Soojah under all
circumstances and difficulties, I must entreat your Lordship’s early
attention to the means of effecting this object, which may be a more
arduous undertaking than the occupation of the country in 1839.”
And again, in the same letter: “There is a dark, perhaps a random
hint, in one of these letters that the rebellion is instigated by the
royal family at Caubul. If so, I would advise the early abandonment
of them, their country, and their cause.” On the 28th he again wrote:
“I really would not advise our forcing either him or ourselves upon a
nation so distant, and in all respects so dissimilar both to our Sepoys
and ourselves, at an expense so decidedly ruinous.” And on the 30th,
in still more emphatic language, he said: “My opinion regarding a
renewal of our efforts to support Shah Soojah on his throne, and to
establish a permanent influence in Afghanistan, is without change or
modification. That we have no base of operations has been always
clear; but now, were we to march a reinforcement on the best horses,
we could not be sure of carrying the Khybur Pass, and if snow has
fallen, the road to Caubul would still be closed.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence
of Sir J. Nicolls.</i>]</p>

 Two days before, Captain (afterwards Sir Henry) Lawrence, Assistant
to Mr. Clerk, whose later career justified the high expectations
which were formed of him during his connexion with the North-Western
Agency, on his way out after a dacoity party, met the intelligence
of the Caubul outbreak, and immediately after forwarding it on
to Mr. Clerk went to Colonel Wild, to urge him to push on the 60th
and 64th Regiments, and to warn the Light Infantry Battalion and
some details of the 10th Cavalry, for service beyond the frontier.&mdash;[<i>Capt.
Lawrence to Mr. George Clerk: Nov. 14, 1841. MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a></span>
 Mr. Clerk sent forward the 30th, which was Wild’s regiment, in
order that the colonel might take command of the brigade, General
Boyd having thrown out a hint that he was a more efficient officer than
the colonels of the other regiments.</p>

 <i>Sir Jasper Nicolls to Government: January 23rd.</i> See also
private journal, “<i>Thanesur</i>, January 23rd.&mdash;Mr. C. joined us on the
ground. He is anxiously in favour of our sending forward more troops,
in view, I believe, to our undertaking the re-conquest of Caubul. To
this I decidedly object. We have neither funds nor men available,
without in the latter instance leaving India so bare as to risk its
safety.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 <i>Papers relating to Military Operations in Afghanistan.</i> Lord
Auckland’s private letters were still more decided on these points. “I
should be glad,” he wrote to Sir Jasper Nicolls on the 10th of February,
“to hear that Sir R. Sale has been able to withdraw his brigade from
a position so perilous as to make me regard its possible fate with
extreme anxiety.” Two days afterwards he wrote to the same correspondent:
“I have from the beginning believed a second conquest of
Caubul with our present means to be absolutely impossible.”&mdash;[<i>MS.
Correspondence</i>.]</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a></span>
 It was, moreover, of great importance to accelerate the movement,
because it was believed that any day might witness the appearance of
the Barukzye horsemen on the road between Peshawur and Jellalabad.
“Time is most precious to us,” wrote Mackeson to Clerk; “a few
days more may see a party of the Barukzye troops in the plains of
Ningrahar, and then thousands will be required where hundreds now
would do the work.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a></span>
 Shere Singh despatched urgent purwannahs both to General
Avitabile and to Raee Kishen Chund, calling upon them to aid the
British by every means in their power. “You are a general of the
Khalsa Government,” he wrote to the former, “and noted for the confidence
placed in you. This is the time to serve the two allied powers;
and you will, therefore, unreservedly devote your attention to discharge
your trust, so as to please the two friendly governments, and to earn
such a name that the services performed shall be known in London.”
To the latter he wrote, “Orders have been issued to Koonwur Pertab
Chund to march to Peshawur, and the zeal of the Durbar will at once
make itself manifest to Mr. Clerk (as the sun suddenly shining forth
from beneath a cloud) when he is informed of all by the letters of
Captain Mackeson.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] When Mackeson received from
George Clerk a copy of the purwannah to Avitabile he was in conference
at that officer’s quarters with the Sikh general, Mehtab Singh, and
the commandants of all the Sikh battalions. “I read out this purwannah,”
says Mackeson, “but was somewhat confounded to find at
its conclusion that the Durbar limited the operations of General Avitabile
and the Sikh troops to Futtehgurh&mdash;their own frontier post. It
was fortunate that, before the arrival of this <i>purwannah</i>, the commandants
of the auxiliary Mussulman troops had left the room, having
previously engaged to march as far as Ali-Musjid in support of our
troops, and to move on again with General Pollock’s brigade.”&mdash;[<i>Mackeson
to Clerk: January, 1842. MS. Records.</i>] The passages
referred to in the <i>purwannah</i> might bear this construction, but it is
doubtful whether this was their intent. George Clerk, in a marginal
note to Mackeson’s letter, says: “The <i>purwannah</i> did not limit it;
but directed them to move on to Futtehgurh and act in concert and by
Captain Mackeson’s advice.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 A cousin of Captain Mackeson. Holding no recognised place in
the army either of the Crown or the Company, his services were neither
fairly estimated nor adequately rewarded. But there were few more
gallant episodes in the war than his defence of Ali-Musjid. Mr.
Mackeson had been long disabled by extreme sickness, but was carried
about in a litter to superintend the defence.</p>

 “The <i>Nujeebs</i> struck their tents when we did, and moved back to
Peshawar, and the Sikhs made no demonstration, though twice we
wrote to General Avitabile during the night; and just before daylight
I told him they were not moving, and again at sunrise.”&mdash;[<i>Captain
H. M. Lawrence to Mr. Clerk: 19th January, 1842.</i>] Lawrence
adds: “I impute no blame to General Avitabile for the man not
telling us what we might expect from his miscreant troops. His own
intentions are kind and friendly to our government and ourselves.”
The misconduct of the Sikh troops was rendered more atrocious, and
our own mortification more bitter, by the circumstance that Mackeson
had advanced a lakh and a half of rupees to the Sikh authorities, for
the payment of the men whose services we hoped to retain.</p>

 “We have been disgracefully beaten back,” wrote Captain Lawrence
to Mr. Clerk. “Both our large guns broke down; one was on
an elephant, but was taken down to put together when the other failed,
but its carriage breaking too, the Sepoys lost all heart, and I grieve to
say that I could not get men to bring one off, though I tried for an
hour, and at last, finding we were only expending ammunition, we left
it in their hands, but it was broken completely down and spiked.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

 “I confess,” wrote Captain Lawrence to Mr. Clerk, “that I
never heard any very heavy fire, or saw the enemy in any numbers.
I was not with the advance, and therefore may be mistaken; but was
afterwards within a hundred yards of the advanced gun for an hour or
more, and could see into the pass, but observed no breast-work, and
but very few of the enemy; certainly not above a thousand, and not
half that number of fire-arms.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 <i>Mr. G. Clerk to Sir Jasper Nicolls: November 17, 1841.</i> I have
taken this passage from a MS. copy. It is quoted, however, in the
Blue Book, but with the usual fatality attending such compilations,
there are two errors in these few lines. Mr. Clerk is made to say that
he had called upon “the commanding officer of <i>Lahore</i> and Ferozepore”
to send forward the regiments.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a></span>
 It is not very clear, however, that Captain Lawrence actually
made any written requisition to the commanding officer at Ferozepore
(Colonel Wild) for the despatch of artillery details. He wrote a private
letter to Mr. Clerk, saying: “If four guns can be made effective, they
also shall be got ready.” In this letter he says that he was about to
call upon Colonel Wild; and he may orally have broached the subject of
the guns; but in his official letter, written on the same day (November
14), there is no mention of artillery, although he suggests the expediency
of sending forward the 10th Cavalry without delay.</p>

 “Though I have not yet heard that any artillery is ordered up to
the frontier, I would beg leave to recommend, in anticipation of the
speedy arrival of reinforcements so necessary on the Sutlej, that
artillery should move forward from hence. I shall transmit a copy of
this letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Wild, in case he may think proper to
halt one of the regiments under his command, until the arrival of such
artillery as you consider can best be spared from Loodhianah or Ferozepore;
but the latter is, I believe, for want of horses, incapable of
moving; and this leaves an insufficiency for the due protection of this
border, during an unsettled state of parties at Lahore.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. George

observe it, I rely on your addressing yourself to them in a very forcible
manner, and shaming them out of such very unbecoming, unmilitary,

 <i>Sir Jasper Nicolls to Lord Hill: Simlah, September 2nd, 1842.</i>&mdash;[<i>MS.
Correspondence.</i>] In this letter, which will be found entire in
the Appendix, the Commander-in-Chief says: “When Major-General
Pollock arrived at Peshawur he found 1800 men of the four regiments
in hospital; the Sepoys declaring that they would not again advance
through the Khybur Pass; the Sikh troops spreading alarm, and in all
ways encouraging and screening their desertion, which was considerable.
It was well that a cautious, cool officer of the Company’s army
should have to deal with them in such a temper, 363 miles from our
frontier. General Pollock managed them extremely well.”</p>

 An intelligent and trustworthy officer of the 26th Native Infantry,
whose letter is now before me, writes: “In less than forty-eight hours
after our (the 9th Foot and 26th Native Infantry) arrival, active emissaries,
particularly from the 53rd and 60th Regiments, were in our
camp, using every effort to induce our men to desert, and to refuse to
enter the Khybur; and had actually gone the length of sending Brahmins
with the Gunga Jul to swear them in not to advance; and did not
desist until orders were given to seize the first man caught in the lines
under suspicious circumstances. This information was several times
communicated to me by old Sepoys and non-commissioned officers, and
the fact of the attempts made to seduce the men from their allegiance
is too well known to the officers of the 26th to admit of a moment’s
doubt.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 <i>Memorandum by Major George Broadfoot.</i>&mdash;“Captain Macgregor
vehemently denied that we had ever received hostages at Tezeen. I
mentioned several things to show that we had; but, as he persisted in
his denial, I said that I had been under some extraordinary delusion,
and that, of course, any argument founded on it must fall to the ground,
but I still held hostages utterly worthless while the enemy had our
hostages and prisoners in their hands.” Again, Broadfoot says:
“Hostages were announced in General Sale’s orders, and reported to
General Elphinstone. I was blamed for opposing one of them in a fight
at the time; and afterwards met him in charge of Captain Mackenzie
on his mission to General Pollock, when he reminded me of having
nearly killed him when he was a hostage. There are many grounds for
still thinking that I was right.” <i>Both</i> were, to a certain extent, right.
The men to whom Broadfoot referred were not actually hostages. They
were Afghan agents, sent into the British camp to re-establish our
thannahs, &amp;c. So Macgregor describes them in his despatch. Macnaghten,
referring to them, in a letter dated October 27, says: “I
explained to his Majesty that these people were not sent as hostages,
but merely to assist our troops and be the medium of friendly communication.”</p>

 It need scarcely be said that this account of the councils at Jellalabad,
which appears for the first time in the present edition, is based
upon what I conceive to be undeniable evidence, which has come into
my possession since the book was first published. No one who peruses
it should, for a moment, lose sight of the fact that the responsibility
was with Sale and Macgregor, who had to regard the position in which
they were placed with respect to Shah Soojah’s and to their own government,
both of which were, at that time, believed to be anxious for the
evacuation of Jellalabad. In circumstances similar to those which
surrounded Broadfoot and Backhouse, I do not doubt that Sale and
Macgregor would have counselled the same course of resistance. We err
greatly when we judge by the same standard men in supreme and men
in subordinate command. Apart even from the consideration of the
paralysing effects of a sense of responsibility, it is obvious that what is
a man’s duty in one case, is not his duty in another. There were no
braver spirits in the garrison than those of Sale and Macgregor.</p>

Broadfoot for taking with him an unnecessary supply of tools. The

 The work of the Jellalabad garrison was not confined to the
strengthening of their own defences. The destruction of all the adjoining
cover for the enemy was no small part of their labour. With
reference to these works, General Sale says, in his official report:
“Generally I may state that they consisted in the destruction of an
immense quantity of cover for the enemy, extending to the demolition
of forts and old walls, filling up ravines and destroying gardens, and
cutting down groves, raising the parapets to six or seven feet high,
repairing and widening the ramparts, extending the bastions, retrenching
three of the gates, covering the fourth with an outwork, and
excavating a ditch ten feet in depth and twelve feet in width round the
whole of the walls. The place was thus secure against the attacks of
any Asiatic army not provided with siege artillery.” This admirable
report was written by Havelock, as were all Sale’s Jellalabad despatches.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a></span>
 “But it pleased Providence, on the 19th of February, to remove
in an instant this ground of confidence. A tremendous earthquake
shook down all our parapets, built up with so much labour, injured
several of our bastions, cast to the ground all our guard-houses,
demolished a third of the town, made a considerable breach in the
rampart of a curtain in the Peshawur face, and reduced the Caubul
gate to a shapeless mass of ruins. It savours of romance, but is a
sober fact, that the city was thrown into alarm, within the space of
little more than one month, by the repetition of full one hundred
shocks of this terrific phenomenon of nature.”&mdash;[<i>Report of General
Sale: Jellalabad, April 16, 1842.</i>] “On the 19th of February, an
earthquake, which nearly destroyed the town, threw down the greater
part of the parapets, the Caubul gate with two adjoining bastions, and
a part of the new bastion which flanked it. Three other bastions were
also nearly destroyed, whilst several large breaches were made in the
curtain, and the Peshawur side, eighty feet long, was quite practicable,
the ditch being filled, and the descent easy. Thus in one moment the
labours of three months were in a great measure destroyed.”&mdash;[<i>Report
of Captain Broadfoot, Garrison Engineer.</i>]</p>

 “The officers of the garrison,” wrote Macgregor to Pollock on the
21st of February, “came upon rations to-day. They are willing to
brave all difficulties and dangers, now that they feel certain that
government will resent the insult offered to our national honour by
these rascally Afghans.” And again, on the same day, writing to the
same correspondent, he said: “I am glad to find that government
intend to uphold the national honour by resenting the insults which
have been offered to it by the rascally Afghans; and I feel assured that
this garrison will continue to perform the part which has devolved
upon them at this crisis with credit to themselves and advantage to the
state. General Sale intends to publish in to-day’s garrison orders the
proclamation of the Indian Government, a copy of which you kindly

 The rescue of the Jellalabad garrison had in reality been the
primary&mdash;indeed, the sole acknowledged reason of the movement in
advance; but the Supreme Government, whilst by no means unmindful
of the claims of the Jellalabad garrison, long omitted to communicate
with Sale or Macgregor&mdash;to convey to them directly any instructions
for their guidance, or any expressions of approbation of their conduct.</p>

 <i>General Pollock to General Sale: March 27th, 1842. MS. Correspondence.</i>
Pollock did not exaggerate the backwardness of the
native regiments, or the importance of associating with them a larger
body of Europeans. Even the new corps which were moving up from
the provinces, and which the General believed to be “without a
taint,” were openly expressing their disinclination to advance. Shere
Singh mentioned this to Mr. Clerk. “Yesterday, early,” wrote the latter,
“the Maharajah, Rajah Dhyan Singh, and myself, being together for a
short time, quite unattended, they told me that Commandant Cheyt
Singh, who had come into Lahore for a day from Colonel Bolton’s camp,
to escort which from Ferozepore to Peshawur the Durbar had appointed
him, had mentioned that our Sepoys in that brigade did not like going
to the westward, and were sometimes grouped eight or ten together,
expressing their dissatisfaction; but that on the other hand the Europeans
(her Majesty’s 31st and artillery) were much delighted at the
prospect of fighting with the Afghans. The Maharajah added, ‘If you
could send two or three more European corps, they would penetrate the
Khybur or anywhere else so successfully against the Afghans, that the
Hindoos, who are now alarmed, would, after one action, all take
heart again.’”&mdash;[<i>Mr. Clerk to Government: Lahore, March 19th,

 Shere Singh was at this time a confirmed drunkard, and he thought
more of potations than of politics. When the first intelligence of our
Caubul disasters reached him, Mr. Clerk wrote: “The effect which
these events in Caubul will have on Lahore, will, I imagine, be as
follows. The Rajahs will inwardly rejoice thereat; the Khalsa will be
vexed at any Mahomedan exultation; and Shere Singh will congratulate
himself on the prospect this may open to him of drawing closer his
relations with us as a means of procuring good champagne.”&mdash;[<i>Mr.

 Their design was to arrest the progress of Gholab Singh’s force;
and some of our officers thought that the Rajah ought to have attacked
them. But Mr. Clerk was of opinion that his forbearance was a proof
of his friendship towards us. “In the same manner,” he wrote, “that
the reluctance of Rajah Gholab Sing to have recourse to measures of
open hostility towards the Mussulman battalions, when arrayed against
him across the Attock, was, I believe, in a great measure caused by his
apprehension of embarrassing the British brigade coming up and near
at hand, should he be found making of the high road an unseemly and
uncertain field of battle for the coercion of mutinous battalions, so I
conceive that he may very naturally feel disinclined hastily to pledge
himself to take as far as Jellalabad, or into any arduous service, troops
which for fourteen months past have generally assumed a tone of defiance
of the control of their appointed officers.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. George Clerk to Government:

 Gholab Singh was employed in the Hazareh country in operations
against Poyndah Khan and a rebel force when he was summoned to
proceed to Peshawur. At this time, too, the Jummoo Rajah had an
army in Ladakh and Thibet engaged in active warfare with the
Chinese, and it was sustaining serious reverses at the time that Gholab
Singh was called upon to aid the British Government. “What with
this reverse on the eastern frontier of his possessions,” wrote Mr.
Clerk to government, “and the apprehension that in his absence his
lately victorious troops will lose ground in the Hazareh country, Rajah
Gholab Singh evinces little ardour to co-operate with the Sikh troops
at Peshawur. It is also probable that the Jummoo Rajah would rather
contemplate the difficulties of the British Government in that quarter,
than be instrumental in removing them.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. Clerk to Government:

 “Lawrence is making out a digest of our conversation with the

proves serviceable, he should, contrary to the orders of government,
continue to maintain Jellalabad, whilst awaiting further orders from
government on the subject.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. Clerk to Mr. Robertson: Umritsur,

 “The aversion which the Sikhs have to penetrate the Khybur is
not more inconvenient to the British Government than it is alarming to
the Maharajah; for their resentment against the government, which
has imposed upon them the arduous duty, will be enhanced, should
they suffer from the swords of the Afghans. Nor can any thinking
person in this Durbar fail to apprehend that by proceeding to invade
Afghanistan in support of its ally, whilst deprived by the circumstances
of the alliance of all latitude of securing parties among the Afghans,
such as it would create and turn to advantage in aid of its encroachments,
if acting on its own account, it may be raising a hornet’s nest
which may involve the Khalsa in long wars for the preservation of its
territories on the Indus.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. George Clerk to Government: Lahore,

 “My detention here has been most annoying. We have had heavy
rain, and the Sikhs begged that I would wait till to-morrow. I have
consented to this, because the troops of both powers advancing simultaneously
for the same purpose ought to produce a good effect. I should
have been better pleased had Mahomed Akbar not sent the last reinforcement&mdash;save
the guns, which I hope we shall be able to give a good
account of. The pluck of the Sepoys is doubtful; but I hope when we
carry the mouth of the pass, they will feel confidence. The 9th are
most anxious to be let loose, and&mdash;please God! by to-morrow, we shall
be well into the pass... I still much regret that I have not the
31st; but after Sir Robert Sale’s letter received some time back, I
consider that he has put it out of my power to wait longer, although I
am quite sure that the addition of 900 Europeans would have operated
very favorably for the prisoners. I, however, hope that you will be
able, through the Ghilzyes, to pave the way for their release when we
reach you.”&mdash;[<i>General Pollock to Captain Macgregor: Jumrood,

 The negotiations, indeed, failed altogether. The chiefs had given
hostages, and were to have received 50,000 rupees, for the safe conduct
of the force from Jumrood to Dhaka&mdash;one moiety to be paid in advance,
and the other on the army reaching the latter place. “They were to
clear the pass for us to Dhaka, and make arrangements for guarding it
afterwards. They engaged to remove all hostile Afreedis from the pass,
as far as Ali-Musjid, and then we were to repel any troops of Mahomed
Akbar Khan sent to oppose us.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Mackeson to General
Pollock: April 2, 1842. MS. Records.</i>] Mackeson adds: “Yesterday
the Afreedis in our pay proposed to seize on the mouth of the
pass; but as the Sikhs were not ready to move on, and they promised
to be ready on the following day, the movement was postponed.
To-day the Afreedis of our party have pleaded that Mahomed Akbar’s
troops have come down to the mouth of the pass, and that they can no
longer perform their agreement. They offer to return the money that
has been given to them.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 “The Sepoys behaved nobly,” wrote General Pollock, on the day
after the action. “They merely required a trial in which they should
find that they were not sacrificed. There were, however, many desertions
before we advanced. Now they are in the highest spirits, and
have a thorough contempt for the enemy. This is a great point gained.
You are aware that Mahomed Akbar sent a party, about 800, with one
or two guns, to oppose us; but they thought better of it, and
abandoned the fort of Ali-Musjid this morning. I have accordingly
taken possession. The Sikhs are encamped near us, and are much
more respectful and civil since our operations of yesterday.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

 “I have been given to understand that, on the advance of our army
to Jellalabad, the Sikh authorities at Peshawur, without intimating
their intentions to Captain Lawrence, and without reference to any
engagements between the Afreedis and ourselves, entered into arrangements
with the Afreedis to purchase, for the sum of 6000 rupees or
4000 rupees, the security of that portion of the pass they have engaged
to protect for a period of two months. The parties they agreed to pay
were Abdul Rahman Khan, Kooki Kheil, Mahomed Jalim Sipa, and
Alia Dad Malik, Din Kheil, son of Khan Bahadur, all of whom were at
that time hostile to us, although Abdul Rahman Khan has since come
over. There could have been no objection to the Sikhs entering into an
arrangement with the Afreedis; but it should have been done in communication
with us, and without imparting to the Afreedis the term
for which the Sikhs were bound to hold the pass.”&mdash;[<i>Mackeson to

 “I regret to have to report that the Sikh regiments posted at Ali-Musjid,
yesterday left their post, and returned to Jumrood; on their
way throwing the loads off some of our mules and bullocks that they
met, and employing the animals to carry their own baggage. My letter
to Koonwur Pertab Singh, and his answer, are herewith enclosed. You
will observe that the whole Sikh regiment was actually recalled by
order, without notice being given to me, or without their being relieved,
although four regiments were within a mile of them.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Lawrence

<p class="pfc4">“I waited on Koonwur Pertab Singh yesterday. I spoke strongly on
the outrage of the morning, and on the necessity of a severe example
being made of the offenders.... I repeatedly returned to the

said, there could be no difficulty in recognising, as they were for hours
in the heart of the town, and had been seen by General Avitabile himself,
as well as by Captains Lane and Johnstone, and by many of the
Commissariat agents. It was not denied that the men could be recognised;
but I much fear that no punishment will be inflicted on them.”&mdash;[<i>Lawrence

 Mr. Gleig says: “On the 2nd, Sir Robert Sale proceeded to distribute
the captured sheep among the corps and departments composing
his garrison. The 25th declined to accept the boon. They sent a
deputation to the General, which respectfully acquainted him that
animal food was less necessary for them than for Europeans, and
besought him to give their portion of the booty to their gallant comrades
of the 13th. No wonder that between these two corps there should
have sprung up a romantic friendship, which, though the accidents of
service have parted them, probably for ever, neither is likely to forget,
at all events as a tradition, while they keep their places respectively in
the armies of the Queen and of the East India Company.”</p>

 Mr. Gleig gives the following account of Dennie’s end: “With
undaunted resolution the 13th rushed at the fort, Colonel Dennie nobly
leading; and finding the aperture sufficiently large to admit of it, they
rushed through the outer wall&mdash;only to find themselves exposed to a
murderous fire from the untouched defences of the inner keep. Here
Dennie received, just as he approached the breach, his mortal wound.
A ball entered the side, passing through the sword-belt; and he bent
forward upon his horse. Lieutenant and Adjutant (now Captain)
Wood instantly rode up to him, and expressed a hope that the hurt was
not serious. But it was more than serious; it was fatal. A couple of
orderlies, by Captain Wood’s direction, turned his horse’s head homewards,
and leading it by the bridle, endeavoured to guide him to the
town. But he never reached it alive. He died with the sound of
battle in his ears, hoping, but not living to be assured, that it would
end triumphantly.”</p>

 A letter to General Pollock, written on the 18th of March, says:
“Affairs here are as unsettled as they can possibly be. The day before
yesterday the commandant of the Newab’s regiment was bribed by his
Majesty to desert to the Balla Hissar with all his soldiers. The Newab
demanded their restoration, but was refused. Yesterday, after much
dispute, his Majesty sent a message to our host, saying that the commandant
should be sent to Ameen-oollah’s house if we were delivered
over to the same authority. Fortunately for us the Newab refused to
give us up. This proposition was made through jealousy of the
Newab, and with the view to conciliate Ameen-oollah, by whom it had
been represented to his Majesty that we were supplying our host with
money, &amp;c. Ameen-oollah had been for many days trying to get possession
of our persons with a view to try and extort money from us.
His Majesty’s proposition nearly cost us our lives.... Since the
desertion of the commandant the whole city has been in an uproar.
The shops are all closed, and every man has armed himself. The
feeling against us is reawakened. The gates of the Balla Hissar are
half shut; and each chief has collected his followers. Three or four
thousand men have flocked round our host. The Barukzye’s and Suddozye’s
party-spirit bids fair to be renewed with all its rancour....
The King has, however, now but few friends, and his parsimony is as a
proverb; and his suspected connexion with us adds to his unpopularity....
The Naib has written for the Kohistanees to accompany him on
a crusade, and unless some accommodation is made with his Majesty,
the Balla Hissar will in all probability be the first point of attack. It
will be a popular cause, as there are hopes of plunder.”</p>

 On the 2nd of April Mohun Lal wrote from Caubul: “A letter has
been received by Mahomed Akbar Khan, which was carried by Ameen-oollah
Khan and read by the Shah. It also passed under my sight
through the kindness of the Persian chiefs. It contained that Mahomed
Akbar has been always writing to send the troops to assist him against
Jellalabad, but nobody has heard him. Now he has been informed by
his trusty men at Peshawur that five battalions of the English have
reached Hussna Abdal, and when they join the forces at Peshawur they,
in company with the battalions of the Najeebs of the Sikhs, will force
their march through Khaibur, though he has sent Sultan Jan with a
few hundred men to reinforce the people of Khaibur; but if the
English enter and pass the Khaibur once, no one shall be able to oppose
them. Therefore the chiefs, as well as the Shah, at Caubul, should
not quarrel for the distribution of the money and ranks, but exert
themselves to come down immediately to Jellalabad and reduce it before
the English should pass Khaibur; otherwise he (Akbar) is risking and
ending his life for the faith of Mahomed, and will continue to exert
himself as long as he lives.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 “The Shah, I am told, has made up his mind again to proceed in

 The murderer was a godson of the Shah, who had shown great
personal kindness to the youth. It is said that his evil passions had
been greatly excited, not only by the disappointment spoken of in the
text, but by the fact also that when he went to remonstrate, the King
caused the purdah or curtain of his Durbar tent to be let down, and so
denied ingress to the remonstrant.</p>

 Mohun Lal, in a letter to Captain Mackeson, Caubul, April 10,
1842, says: “Prince Futteh Jung was taken prisoner in the fort of
Mahomed Khan, Bayat, and at even released by force of Ameen-oollah
and the Populzyes. As soon as he reached the palace he opened the
treasury hoarded up with great pains by his father, the King. He
spends a good deal of it, to employ the people and make his party
strong.... It is estimated to be twenty lakhs in cash and a considerable
quantity of jewels.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 I utterly repudiate the cant which fixes the stigma of ingratitude
on the character of Shah Soojah. No one knew better than the Shah
that we had carried him back to Caubul, and kept him there not for
his purposes but for our own.</p>

 Macgregor was of opinion that after the departure of the British
from Caubul, the conduct of the Shah indicated a friendly feeling
towards us. “The Shah is, I believe, acting in a friendly manner
towards us,” he wrote to General Pollock; “and will, if he has the
power, prevent the march of an army from Caubul. He knows that
whilst Dost Mahomed is in our possession we can make use of him as a
powerful weapon against his Majesty, and this is the great hold we
have upon his friendship.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

commanding in Afghanistan, to request that you will immediately
direct the whole of the troops under orders to return to Hindostan
from Candahar to march upon Caubul instead of Shikarpore,
excepting any that shall have got beyond the Khojuck Pass, and that
you will instruct the officers who may command to use the utmost
practicable expedition. You are requested to attach a troop of his
Majesty the Shah’s Horse Artillery to the above force, and likewise
half the first regiment of cavalry.</p>

<p class="pfr2">“<span class="smcap">J. Paton</span>, Capt. A. Q. M. G.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“To Major-General Nott, Commanding at Candahar.”</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">This letter was sent, under a flying seal, through Colonel Palmer, at
Ghuznee, and Major Leech, at Khelat-i-Ghilzye&mdash;Palmer sent it on
with this indorsement: “The country getting more disturbed every
day. Burnett came in yesterday after being attacked on the road. He
was pursued, when he fortunately fell in with some horsemen I had
sent after the fifty-two camels from Candahar, which have been taken
off. No tidings of Crawford.” Leech wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfr2 p1">“Khelat, Nov. 12, 1841.</p>

following words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfr2">“Caubul, Nov. 3, 1842.</p>

<p class="pfc4">“<span class="smcap">My dear Rawlinson</span>,&mdash;We have a very serious insurrection in the
city just now, and from the elements of which it is composed, I apprehend
much disturbance in the surrounding country for some time to
come. It would be only prudent, therefore, that the 16th, 42nd, and
43rd, with a troop of horse artillery and some cavalry, should come
here immediately. General Nott will be written to officially in this
respect. We have been shelling the city all day, but apparently with
little effect. I hope there will be no difficulty about supplies. Your
writing to Leech will obviate this. On second thoughts I shall forward
this letter under a flying seal through Palmer and Leech. Unless you
send up this reinforcement there will be a probability of our supplies
being cut off.</p>

by 160, or if possible, 200 men&mdash;infantry.” Another indorsement

 It does not appear that the conduct of Lieutenant Crawford was,
in any way, open to censure. He was the bearer, as has been shown,
of written instructions, authorising him to destroy the prisoners if they
attempted to escape, but there seems to have been no connivance between
them and the party who attacked the escort. Crawford himself
says, in a narrative which he drew up, and which was subsequently
published in a Bombay paper: “One prisoner was cut down by a
horseman of the enemy (plainly showing there was no collusion between
them), two others rolled over in a ditch, where, with their horse a top
of them, and their legs chained under his belly, I left them; indeed, I
now found it was impossible I could ever get my charge into Ghuznee
alive, and I had only to decide on putting them to death or setting
them at liberty. My instructions would have justified my pursuing
the former course, but the poor wretches had clearly made no attempt
to escape; they were in no way answerable for the attack made on my
party, as was evident from one of their number falling by the sword of
our adversaries; and I conceived then, and do now conceive, that in
letting these men go with their lives, I was not only acting according
to the strict letter of my instructions, but that justice and humanity
required I should not slay them in cold blood. Had I put them to
death, then Shumshoodeen or Mahomed Akbar would have been equally
justified in taking our lives (the lives of all their prisoners) on the advance
of Pollock and Nott on Caubul. I may add that the Court of
Inquiry, which I called for, after investigating all the circumstances,

 “The mutineers moved down to the Barukzye villages in apparent
expectation of being joined by the Ooloos, but wherever they went they
received neither support nor encouragement, notwithstanding that they
gave out our troops were on the march to destroy the Douranee villages.
The Janbaz at last took up a position at Chuplanee, a village about
twelve miles off, where our cavalry came up with them; Captain
Leeson had to file his men across a difficult canal, and had only just
formed line when the enemy charged in a body. Our men charged at
the same time in line, and the flanks swept round the Janbaz horse,
who were probably not above 150 strong&mdash;numbers having left the rebel
standard before reaching Chuplanee. For about five minutes a splendid
fight took place, hand-to-hand, when the Janbaz broke and fled, pursued
by our cavalry. Of the enemy, about thirty were killed and
fifty wounded in the flight and pursuit. Our loss was trifling.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 <i>General Nott to Major Rawlinson: January 8th, 1842. MS.
Correspondence.</i> There is a characteristic passage in this letter which
is worthy of quotation. “I have no right to interfere with the affairs
of the government of this country, and I never do&mdash;but in reference to
that part of your note where you speak of political influence, I will
candidly tell you that these are not times for mere ceremony, and that
under present circumstances, and at a distance of 2000 miles from the
seat of the Supreme Government, I throw responsibility to the winds,
and tell you that, in my opinion, you have not had for some time past,
nor have you at present, one particle of political influence in this
country.”</p>

 The number of the enemy has been variously stated at all sorts of
amounts, from 5000 to 20,000. General Nott, in his official despatch
addressed to the Military Secretary, says: “After a march of four
hours over a very difficult country, I came in sight of the rebel army,
from fifteen to twenty thousand men, drawn up in a strong position on
the right bank of the Urghundab.” Major Rawlinson says: “From
what I myself saw, as well as from information I have received from
parties in the enemy’s camp, I should estimate their entire force at
5000-3000 of which accompanied the chiefs from Sir-a-bund, whilst
the other 2000 joined from the Alekozye villages.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Journal.</i>]
There is nothing of which the historian ought to speak with less confidence
than the “number of the enemy.” There is nothing more difficult
to determine than the fact; and nothing more likely to draw upon
him a large amount of acrimonious criticism, than his manner of stating
it. As a general proposition, I think it may be laid down that military
commanders seldom under-state the number of the enemy they
have beaten.</p>

 “Two canals in advance of the village were lined by matchlock
men&mdash;the horse crowded the slope of the tuppa upon which Killa-chuk
is built, and occupied the entire space intervening between that village
and Kohuck, the hillocks adjoining which latter place were covered by
large masses of footmen collected from the neighbouring villages to
witness rather than to participate in the combat.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s

 Major Rawlinson, in his despatch of the 6th of March, describes
this affair as a “brief skirmish.” General Nott has described the
action in a few pregnant sentences. A graphic account of it is to be
found in Captain Neill’s <i>Recollections of Four Years’ Service in the
East</i>. Captain Neill was present as Adjutant of her Majesty’s 40th
Regiment. He speaks of the affair as the “Battle of Urghundab.”&mdash;“the
first success after our recent disasters at Caubul,” as it was.
He adds: “The victory having been obtained over a force so immensely
superior to that which was opposed to it by the British, most effectually
damped the spirit of our enemies in that part of the country.” As
Nott’s force had sixteen guns, it can hardly be said that the enemy’s
force was immensely superior.</p>

 The Prince seems to have been inclined to desert to the British in
the course of the action. He and Tej Mahomed (the Sirdar of the
recreant Janbaz, who had been forced to accompany the mutineers after
their attack on their British officers) had been in consultation in the
morning about going over to the British camp. The chiefs had some
suspicion of this, and “when they saw Tej Mahomed detach himself,
they immediately accused the Prince of treachery. They talked, indeed,
of seizing him; upon which the boy, with his immediate followers,
galloped off the field.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>] Tej
Mahomed would have come in; but an inopportune shower of grape
from Blood’s battery kept him at a discreet distance.</p>

 The Douranee chiefs were irritated against Atta Mahomed for precipitating
the conflict with the British. They had been anxious to
stand aloof until the issue of the Caubul contest could be more clearly
seen by them.</p>

 On the 8th of January, the General wrote to Rawlinson: “I am
sorry that I have not the same confidence in Meerza Ahmed which you
appear to have. The force under this man has been in the immediate
vicinity of Candahar for the last month. Why this has been permitted
I know not. He has a very considerable body of men with him, both
horse and foot; and my information tells me that they are increasing
daily and hourly.... You ought to be the best judge of this
man’s fidelity; but I believe him to be a traitor; and I should not be
surprised to hear of his being joined by his expected confederates, and
before twenty-four hours marching off and forcing the young Prince
Sekunder to accompany him. Yet he is on the watch, and will play
his game according to circumstances.”&mdash;[<i>General Nott to Major Rawlinson:
January 8th, 1842. MS. Correspondence.</i>] The position of
Meerza Ahmed, and the near prospect of his defection, were among the
reasons urged by the General in support of his refusal to quit the near
neighbourhood of Candahar.</p>

 He was not, however, completely successful. It would have been
a miracle if he had been. “<i>February 4.</i>&mdash;There have been several
squabbles in the Douranee camp already: 1stly. A quarrel took place
between the Janbaz and Populzyes regarding <i>bhoosa</i>; 2ndly. Sufder
Jung fell out with Meerza Ahmed, and abused him for not spending his
money freely on the Ghazees; and 3rdly. The Janbaz have regularly
cleaned out an Ishakzye Khail in another dispute about supplies.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 Major Rawlinson, preparatory to the commencement of the work
of disarming, took a census of the inhabitants of the city, which
greatly alarmed the people, as it was believed to be our intention to
expel them. When it was found that they were only to be disarmed,
they recovered their serenity, and submitted very patiently to the
ordeal.</p>

 “<i>February 21.</i>&mdash;Two Cossids reached me to-day from Leech, one
with letters of the 13th and 15th, the other with letters of the 17th.
Enclosed was a copy of a letter addressed to me by Major-General
Elphinstone and Major Pottinger, requesting me to intimate to Major-General
Nott their wish that he would evacuate Candahar and Khelat-i-Ghilzye,
in pursuance of the agreement entered into at Caubul for the
return of our troops to India. This letter appears to be genuine, but I
cannot consider it in any way binding on us; and for the reasons stated
in my letter to General Nott of the 1st instant, I still conceive that we
are best consulting the interests of government in maintaining our position
pending the receipt of further instructions from Calcutta....
The question regarding Shah Soojah is very perplexing. He is certainly
nominally at the head of the government, and we can no longer
be supposed to be here in support of his authority. Still, however, a
month sooner or later in retiring can make little difference, and it
seems to me indispensable that some definite arrangements, approved of
by government, should be entered into for the future administration of
the province before we withdraw our troops.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s

the evacuation orders received from Caubul, “that I will not treat
with any person whatever for the retirement of the British troops from
Afghanistan, until I shall have received instructions from the Supreme
Government. The letter signed ‘Eldred Pottinger’ and ‘W. K. Elphinstone’
may, or may not, be a forgery. I conceive that these
officers were not free agents at Caubul; and therefore their letter or
order can have no weight with me.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 “I have been for some days past in communication with the
Barukzye tribe, and have, I believe, succeeded in detaching them from
the Douranee confederacy. They had deserted their villages and gone
off to the desert; but, on a promise of protection, have now returned,
and bound themselves to admit none of the enemy’s horse within their
borders. The Alekozyes of the Urghundab also propose to enter into
the same engagements; and if we can fairly detach these two powerful
tribes, the Douranee cause must, I should think, expire of an atrophy....
Timour suggests that he should endeavour to get the Douranee
chiefs to march on Caubul, in order to release the Shah from the
Barukzyes, feigning that he has received his father’s instructions to
this effect; and I see no objection to such an attempt being made. I
also hear that the Caubul Janbaz insist on proceeding to the north, and
that Meerza Ahmed has the greatest difficulty in restraining them.”&mdash;[<i>Major

Afghans must be turned out of the city. It is not as if the present
affair were a mere transient disturbance. We are engaged in a regular
national war, and Outram does not anticipate that we shall be able to
take the field in sufficient force to put down all opposition before next
winter. We must, therefore, look forward to a protracted struggle at
Candahar all through the summer; and the security of the city appears

 A week before, a strong conviction of the necessity of the measure
had forced itself upon his mind. But he was only too willing to postpone
the execution of it. On the 22nd of February he wrote: “The
Moollahs are now again stirring themselves, and I have very good
grounds for supposing a large quantity of arms to be concealed. I
almost fear that affairs are approaching that state when, for our immediate
safety, we shall be obliged to incur the odium of expelling the
Moollahs and Afghans from the city. It is not that these people can
do us any serious injury within the city; but the probability of an insurrection
inside the walls simultaneously with the disturbances outside,
gives confidence to Meerza Ahmed’s party and dispirits our Parsewan
adherents. It is to be considered, however, that if we expel the
Afghans and retain the Parsewans, we shall embitter the national feeling
against us with the rumour of sectarian animosity, and shall,
moreover, sacrifice the Sheeah party in the event of our retirement.
The most obvious necessity of self-preservation could alone, I think,
warrant such a course, and I cannot doubt but that it is my duty to
temporise as long as prudence will admit.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS.

 “No doubt much property has been sacrificed in carrying the

guard, and was endeavouring to trace the movements of the enemy in
the distance, when a villager drove his donkey, loaded with brushwood,
over the bridge and demanded admission. He was told the gate
would be opened for no one; upon which he growled out a malediction,
and tossing the brushwood on the ground, said he would leave it there
for the night, and take it into the town in the morning. The villager,
having recrossed the bridge with his donkey, dived among the ruined
huts opposite the Herat gate, and was out of shot in a moment. At
the same instant flames burst forth from the brushwood, and the gate

 “In the charge of the horse under Saloo Khan, when after driving

Mahomed of Dehrawat, who was Saloo’s nephew, fell, and in another
part of the field, Hubeeboollah, Akhondzadeh, and Mahomed Raheen,
Noorzye, were wounded. The total loss of the enemy in killed and
wounded I estimate, from all I could learn on the field and from the
villagers, at about 150. We had a few men killed and some forty
wounded. Amongst the latter are two cavalry officers, Chamberlaine,
and Travers of the 2nd. The Douranee horse came on more boldly on
this occasion than they had ever been seen to do before. Some of the
38th Sepoys, indeed, received sabre-cuts from our horsemen; but they
cannot stand our artillery or musketry fire. They had been so taunted
with cowardice, that they resolved to have one conflict with us before
they quitted the vicinity of Candahar, and had not reinforcements gone

You cannot picture to yourself the scene these two houses presented;
every room was crammed not only with Sepoys, but camp-followers,

that by sucking them they might relieve the thirst that tormented
them. Certainly, when that morning dawned, I thought it was the
last I should see on this earth, and so did we all, and proceeded to
make a few little arrangements ere the final attack on us took place.
The regimental colours were burned, to prevent their falling into the
hands of the enemy; I destroyed my watch, and flung it, and what
money I had, over the wall of the ditch; I also burnt my poor wife’s
miniature, first cramming the gold frame of it into a musket, being
determined that one of the Ghazees should have his bellyful of gold ere
I died. Hour after hour passed on, and still we sate expecting every
minute to hear the shout of the final attack; but it came not. From
our loopholes we saw the enemy swarming all around us&mdash;in every lane
and house, and on the hill of the citadel&mdash;the place was black with
their masses; and as they themselves afterwards told us, there were
not less than ten thousand men thirsting for our blood.”&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant
Crawford’s Narrative.</i>]</p>

 Lieutenant Crawford says: “During the three preceding days’
fighting, Shumshoodeen had repeatedly offered us terms; but they were
such as we could not accede to, inasmuch as they commenced by desiring
we would surrender ourselves to him and abandon the Sepoys to the
fury of the Ghazees. The Sepoys, it appears, had held a consultation
among themselves, and believing they had no chance of their lives,
determined on forcing their way out of the town and endeavour to get
to Peshawur. When we first heard of this mad design and spoke to
the men about it, they denied it; but, on the 10th, two Native officers
came forward and told us they had made up their minds to go off that
night&mdash;that if we chose to accompany them they would be exceedingly
glad, but, if otherwise, they would go alone.”</p>

 It is pleasant to record any act of individual heroism. The late
Brigadier Nicholson, who fell at Delhi, in 1857, “then quite a stripling,
when the enemy entered Ghuznee, drove them thrice back beyond the
walls at the point of the bayonet before he would listen to the order
given him to make his company lay down their arms. He at length
obeyed, gave up his sword with bitter tears, and accompanied his
comrades to an almost hopeless imprisonment.”&mdash;[<i>Rattray.</i>]</p>

 How strongly Outram felt on the subject of the withdrawal policy
may be gathered from the following passage in a letter to Sir Richmond
Shakespear: “As this is not a time to mince matters, no sooner did I
see the orders of government to General Pollock to withdraw the
Jellalabad garrison, and to retire to India under any circumstances
(except the Sikhs rising against us, which, by-the-by, that measure
would have brought about most probably), than I wrote, in the most
earnest manner I was capable of, pointing out that our bitterest foe
could not have devised a more injurious measure, whether viewed
politically or in a military light; but expressing my trust that Mr.
Clerk would act on the responsibility vested in him to prevent so
ruinous a step. My mind is now set at rest by General Pollock’s
determination, now gleaned from your letters. I honour the General,
therefore; and should he be allowed to carry out his views, we shall
have mainly to thank him, not only for retrieving our honour in
Afghanistan, but for saving India to us, the loss of which would ultimately
result from disgracefully succumbing to the Afghans now....
Nothing is easier than to retrieve our honour in Afghanistan previously
to finally withdrawing, should the government so determine; and I
pray God, Lord Ellenborough may at once see the damnable consequences
of shirking the undertaking, and order accordingly; otherwise the
disaster of Caubul will be but the commencement of our misfortunes.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 “There are some officers in camp who think that Brigadier
England’s detachment will be sacrificed between this and the Kojuck;

 Nott had resolutely refused to send any troops to meet England’s
detachment, though earnestly pressed by Rawlinson to do so. The
General urged that he could not afford to send troops to the Kojuck,
whilst he was liable at any time to be called upon to proceed to the
relief of Khelat-i-Ghilzye. Rawlinson pointed out the immense evils
attending a total deprivation of treasure, and said that even the compulsory
abandonment of Candahar might follow the failure of General
England to effect the passage of the Kojuck. Nott, however, was
obdurate. The detachment was not sent. Wymer’s brigade, however,
was then out to the southward of Candahar, and it was believed that
the object of the movement was to support the party advancing through
the Kojuck. Nott withdrew the brigade to Candahar, and an impression
gained ground among the enemy that we had endeavoured to
open our communications with the troops below, but had drawn back
in despair.</p>

 Of the 20th Bombay Native Infantry. He was greatly esteemed
as a gallant and good soldier. “They have a fine fellow at the head
of the light battalion,” wrote Hammersley to Outram, a few days
before the brigade left Quettah, “and it is to be hoped that he will
inspire the crest-fallen with a little ardour.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 “General England and his staff were dismounted, and standing in
conversation not far from where the light companies had rallied. I
joined them. It was useless to stand and lament over what could not
be recalled. A retreat was determined upon. I observed to the
General that the day might be retrieved, and offered to lead into the
entrenched position with a hundred men properly supported; and I am
confident that I should have succeeded. The men were in courage,
and anxious to recover the bodies of their comrades. The General
replied, he had not men. I proposed that the left hill should be
attacked first, as it commanded the smaller one. The enemy were
certainly in strength, and very bold, but our men burned with rage at
seeing their comrades cut up before their eyes. I think I pressed my
offer three times, the last time volunteering to lead with eighty men;
but the General felt he had too few, and that the stake was too great.”&mdash;[<i>Colonel

 It appears to have been England’s intention, after the disaster on
the 28th, to have commenced his retreat on the same evening; but
Colonel Stacy persuaded him not to move until the following morning.
On the 29th he struck his camp and marched to Hykerzye, halted at
Koochlag on the 30th, and on the 31st reached Quettah.</p>

 Hammersley complained that the General’s letter was so very unsatisfactory,
that if it had not been for some private letters, he would
have been left in ignorance of the real nature of the events that had
occurred. The original letter, now before me, is worth quoting.
England seems to have been so unwilling to state distinctly that he
had been defeated, that even when writing officially to General Nott
on the 1st instant, he shrunk from a plain statement of the circumstances
of the case; so that Nott, writing to him on the 18th, could
only say: “I have been favoured with your letter of the 1st instant,
&amp;c.... I have <i>also heard of the affair you had with the enemy on
the 28th ult</i>.” The letter to Nott is, however, less obscure than the
letter to Hammersley, which runs thus:</p>

<p class="pfr2 p1">“Camp, three miles south of Hykulzye, 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>
<p class="pfc4">“<span class="smcap">My dear Hammersley</span>,&mdash;I wish you would acquaint Colonel
Marshall, that as the insurgent force has been much reinforced from
Candahar, and have so strongly protected themselves with breastworks,
&amp;c., on the ground commanding our line of route this side of Hykulzye,
I shall fall back to Hykerzye to-morrow, my presence here being now
of no use, and inviting their insults; and it is probable that as the
position at Hykerzye is not a good one, having much broken ground in
its rear, that I shall further fall back on Cutchlak. I have had so
many men killed and wounded by the enemy, that my baggage is increased
whilst my means of defending it is lessened. If Colonel Marshall,
through your information, thinks the Cutchlak Pass occupied,
he may make such efforts as his numbers will enable him to keep it
open and communicate with us; and as the enemy is a hundred to one
stronger than any one imagined, I must wait for the reinforcements
till I try them again. Meanwhile, the fortification of Quettah must be
proceeded with vigorously. Show this to Colonel Marshall and Major
Waddington.</p>

 “<i>April 1.</i>&mdash;The Douranees having received positive accounts from

with Mahomed Azim (Noorzye), Fyz Tullub, Hubeeboollah,
Sooltan Mahomed (Barukzye), &amp;c., have gone off by the desert to the
Kojuck Pass. The body of horse with the chiefs is about 1000; but
they expect to raise some 4000 or 5000 of the Noorzye, Atchekzye,

 After adverting to the reported intention of England to leave
Quettah with a small supply of money and ammunition, but not to
push through the Kojuck, Nott goes on to say: “This I deeply regret;
firstly, because I cannot send a force to the southern side of the pass;
secondly, I require a large supply of ammunition, which I have for two
years been endeavouring to get, but without success; thirdly, four
lakhs of rupees will be of little use here&mdash;the troops and establishments
are going on for four months in arrears; fourthly, your moving into
Pisheen with a convoy, known by the whole country to be intended for
Candahar, and then halting or retiring to Quettah, will have the very
worst effects throughout Afghanistan, and will be more injurious to my
present position than 20,000 of the enemy in the field. I sincerely
hope that you have not moved, or that you have determined to push
across the Kojuck with all the force you can muster.”&mdash;[<i>General Nott

 “I strongly advised Brigadier England, through Lieutenant Hammersley,
in letters I addressed to them both so long ago as the 10th

immediate advance to meet an advance from Candahar. The latter, so

 “These fine fellows had been led forward by Colonel Wymer, at
daybreak, to occupy the heights commanding the pass from Chummemo
to the western side, to secure General England’s party a safe passage.
I have never seen our Sepoys to such advantage. It was impossible to
climb the precipitous hills in pantaloons; this part of their dress had,
therefore, been discarded, and the men were in their doties. As they
showed on every accessible point, they were the admiration of all. I
can easily imagine how painful it must have been to the Bombay regiments

 “I have only,” wrote Nott, “to repeat my sentiments&mdash;namely,
that I will not sanction a rupee being given from the British treasury
to these people. I have for three years viewed with deep regret the
ruinous system of giving away large sums to the chiefs and Sirdars of
Afghanistan, which I sincerely believe has brought upon us all our
present difficulties in this country. I have offered to guarantee the
personal safety of Saloo Khan if he returns to his allegiance by a certain
day. If there are any other chiefs who can make it appear that they
are worthy of the indulgence of my guarantee for their personal safety,
I will take their wishes into consideration; but I will make them no
other promises. This does not apply to Mahomed Atta or to Meerza
Ahmed, as I will not receive these two men on any terms, without the
order of higher authority.”&mdash;[<i>General Nott to Major Rawlinson: April

 See <i>Colonel Stacy’s Narrative</i>, and his correspondence with Major
Rawlinson. Rawlinson, however, doubted whether the negotiations
with Saloo Khan would have a favourable result: “Had a long conference,”
he wrote on the 10th of May, “with Atta-oollah Khan, who
has come in to treat for his brother, Saloo; and the latter, if his agent
is to be believed, certainly desires to espouse our cause. Knowing,
however, as I do, Saloo’s ambition and avarice, I question very much
whether we shall come to any satisfactory arrangement with him. We
merely require Saloo Khan’s co-operation, in order to facilitate the
re-establishment of our dawk communication; but the Khan talks of
rank, power, and pay, as the return he has a right to expect for joining
us, and is not likely to be satisfied with any moderate measure of conciliation.”&mdash;(<i>Major
Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>) Saloo Khan, however,
in the sequel rendered good service and proved his fidelity in the face
of strenuous opposition from some of the other chiefs: “His falling off
from the cause of Islam,” wrote Rawlinson in his Journal, “has
plunged him into personal difficulties. He has been twice attacked by
Mahomed Sadig and Meer Afzul, and has been wounded, together with
his brother and his nephew.”</p>

 “Letters are said to have been received from the ex-Sirdars

Reza Khan of Seistan is also said to have promised to assist them with
100 camels, and to send horsemen to escort them to this frontier.
This news appears to be <i>vraisemblable</i> in the extreme. If the ex-Sirdars

connivance of the Persian Government, nothing is more likely than that
they should make an attempt to recover Candahar; and I should
greatly dread their appearance on this frontier, for we are enabled to

 This is not only a remarkable letter in itself. It is remarkable
for its misadventures. Its outer history is somewhat curious. It
never found its way into the published volume of correspondence, and
its existence was only to be inferred from the fact of a reference to it
in another letter. It was at last brought to light by the inquiries in
Parliament of Lord Lansdowne and Lord Palmerston. It was to be
found nowhere in England; but a copy was at last elicited from India.
The Governor-General then declared that “the original despatch of the
13th of May never reached the office, and must have been lost in
transit. The duplicate was received and acknowledged on the 11th of
July. It is the practice of the Secretary’s office to keep the unreported
papers on all important subjects for each month together, and to
forward copies of them to the Secret Committee by the monthly Overland
Mail. The despatch in question was inadvertently put up in its
proper place in the May bundle of reported papers, instead of being
left for a time, as it should have been, among the unreported papers of
July. Hence, when the July papers were copied for transmission to
the Secret Committee, this despatch was omitted.” Nothing less
explanatory than this was ever offered in the way of explanation. It
does not appear whether the original letter miscarried altogether on its
way to Lord Ellenborough, or whether it miscarried only on its way to
the office. There is an equal obscurity about the history of the duplicate
which was “received and acknowledged on the 11th of July.”
It might be inferred from this that it was received on the 11th of July,
and acknowledged on the same day. But it happens that the duplicate
was despatched on the 30th of May&mdash;and ought surely to have come not
among the July, but among the June papers. In this letter of the 11th
of July the Secretary says: “I am directed to state that the original
letter has never reached me, and that the duplicate <i>has only lately been
received</i> and laid before the Governor-General, whose previous instructions
to you appeared to render any special reply to this communication
unnecessary.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] In the face of so distinct a
denial as this, little can be said, except that in a letter from Pollock of
May 20th, which was duly acknowledged, reference is made to the
letter of the 13th. If that letter had not been received, some allusion
certainly ought to have been made by Government to its non-receipt.</p>

 There was no scarcity of provisions at Jellalabad at this time.
But, to secure a continued supply, Pollock was sensible of the necessity
of encouraging a belief throughout the country that the intentions of
the British Government inclined towards a forward movement. “We
are all quiet here,” he wrote on the 6th of May to Mr. Clerk, “grain
coming in in abundance; at least, in as great quantities as we could
expect after the dreadful alarm into which this force seems to have put
the whole country. Every village was deserted. I did my utmost to
protect them from plunder, and in most cases succeeded; and the consequence
is that we, in a measure, command the resources of the
country.” And on the 11th of the same month, writing again to Mr.
Clerk, he said: “While I remain here I can command supplies, and I
have no doubt that I shall be able to do so as long as the natives
suppose that we intend remaining in the country; but if they thought
otherwise, our supplies would be stopped.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

possible until Caubul should be retaken. As there is no discretionary

had to consider the best way of carrying the order into effect.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

 “In a late letter to government,” he wrote to the Commander-in-Chief
on the 24th of May, “you will have seen how anxious I was
that any proposed movement towards Peshawur should be communicated
to no one from whom it could be withheld. The moment such a
thing is known, it is probable supplies will cease to come in; we should
be in difficulty about forage; all who are now friendly would be ready
to oppose us; and if I had not time to secure the pass, the consequences
might be serious indeed.”&mdash;[<i>Published Papers relating to

 In this letter of the 20th of May, Pollock says: “I have already,

to Peshawur), and must receive a reply before I shall be able

 It was outwardly only an acknowledgment of the General’s
inability to retire at an earlier period&mdash;but there was more meaning
in it than this, for on the same day the Chief Secretary wrote to Nott:
“I am directed to inform you that, in consequence of the very defective
state of the means of movement possessed by Major-General Pollock, it
appears to be out of his power to retire from Jellalabad until October,
when his retirement will certainly take place.”&mdash;[<i>Published Papers.</i>]</p>

 <i>Major Pottinger to General Pollock: Tezeen, April 20, 1842. Published
Papers.</i> Together with this letter from Pottinger came a
paper from Akbar Khan himself. It was without seal and signature,
for the Sirdar was fearful of compromising himself with his countrymen,
and the document might have fallen into their hands. After
some allusions to the painful past, and a declaration that he was
unable to restrain the disorganised mob of Afghans from attacking the
English army, the Sirdar went on to say: “If I allow the English,
who are my guests, to depart according to your suggestion; or
according to Pottinger Sahib’s advice, if I allow the English ladies to
depart before the gentlemen, in either case all Mahomedans will look
upon me as their enemy, and the whole multitude will be opposed to
me. Under these circumstances I beg you to reflect, that not having
come to an understanding with you, and having made enemies of them,
how can I exist?... I prefer your friendship to the throne of
Caubul, because, if I was to go to Caubul now, the men of Caubul
would push me forward, and then it would be difficult to release my
guests and to be on friendly terms with you. On this account I have
written to show my friendship for your government. Please God my
services shall exceed the injuries I have done you.”</p>

In reply to this letter, the Chief Secretary wrote: “It is not consistent
with the honour of the British Government to enter into any terms for
the making of a provision for so great a criminal. We might engage
to spare his life if he were to fall into our hands, because it would be
difficult so to bring him to trial as to protect the government from a
colourable charge of violently prosecuting an unworthy revenge; but
no more than this can be done, and this only if he should promptly do
all he can to repair the crimes he has committed.”&mdash;[<i>Published

 <i>Major Pottinger to General Pollock: May 3, 1842.</i> I have
quoted from the original in Pottinger’s hand-writing. But the letter is
given among the published papers, with the usual official emendations.
Thus the passage, “They have asked for the money, if it is paid, to be
given to Sir-Bolund Khan”&mdash;is printed, “They have asked for the
money, &amp;c., to be given to <i>his Colund Khan</i>.” It may puzzle the
future historian to discover who “his Colund Khan” may have been.</p>

 <i>General Pollock to Major Pottinger: Jellalabad, May 10, 1842.
Published Papers.</i> Lord Ellenborough was unwilling that any money
should be paid for the release of the captives; but was inclined to
exchange Dost Mahomed and his family for the prisoners in the hands
of the Sirdar. “Undoubtedly,” he wrote, “on the 26th of April,
you remained authorised, by the instructions of the 24th of February,
to give money on the public account for the release of individual
prisoners; and if, previously to the receipt of my letter of the 25th of
April, you should have concluded a negotiation for the release of any
individual prisoners on that condition, the Governor-General would
feel himself under the necessity of sanctioning any payment of money to
which you may have then pledged yourself. After the receipt of that
letter, you will, of course, in any future negotiation, have adhered to
the instructions contained in it. It cannot but be a subject of much
regret that you should have considered it to be necessary, under any
circumstances, to have had any communication whatever of a diplomatic
nature with Mahomed Akbar Khan, in whom it must be impossible
for any one to place any trust.”&mdash;[<i>Published Papers.</i>] Akbar
Khan, at this time, seems almost to have considered the release of his
father and family as hopeless; and Pollock did not think he was
authorised to propose an exchange of prisoners; for although, on the
24th of February, Lord Auckland suggested that he “might speak of
the release of Dost Mahomed as an event which might not be altogether
impossible,” he did not know how far such a measure might be
sanctioned by Lord Ellenborough. Moreover, Pollock believed that the
exchange had only been authorised in the event of his being able to
treat for the release of the whole of the British prisoners; and they
were not all in the hands of Akbar Khan.</p>

Sir W. Macnaghten with the rebels? 2nd. What alteration was made
by Major Pottinger? 3rd. What does Major Pottinger allude to when
he talks of breach of faith? 4th. What were the manner and causes

 On that day Akbar Khan sought an interview with Lady Macnaghten.
Painful as such a meeting must have been, the bereaved
widow was not in a position to refuse to see her husband’s murderer.
He spoke very kindly to her; and as she sat in silent sorrow before
him, he declared that he would give his right arm that the deed which
he so much regretted might be undone.</p>

 <i>Captain Johnson’s Journal.</i> The writer adds: “At the commencement
of the defile, and for some considerable distance, passed two
or three hundreds of our poor miserable Hindostanees, who had escaped
up this unfrequented road from the massacre of the 12th. They had
not a rag to cover them, and were all more or less frost-bitten, wounded,
or starving. The poor wretches were huddled together in thirties and
forties, so as to impart to each other a little animal heat, as other
warmth was denied them by the barren, inhospitable wilderness around
them. We afterwards learnt that scarcely one of these poor wretches
escaped from the defile in which they had taken shelter; and that,
driven to the extremes of hunger, some of them had for a few short
hours sustained life by feeding on their dead comrades. The wind was
blowing bitterly cold at our bivouac. No shelter of any kind for the
ladies of our party during the whole night. Happiness is comparative;
and truly fortunate did General Elphinstone, Brigadier Shelton, and
myself consider ourselves when one of our Afghan attendants told us to
accompany him inside a miserable cow-shed, which on our first entrance
was so blackened with the dense smoke from a good blazing fire in the
centre of the hut, that we could see none of the objects around us, until
we had stretched ourselves at length on the floor, and consequently out
of the influence of the smoke, when we perceived our companions to be
three or four half-starved Hindostanees, who had accompanied our
party. Our attendant wished to eject them; but we too truly sympathised
with their sufferings to permit such an act of tyranny. We
shortly afterwards got an invitation from Mahomed Akbar to join him
and his party to dinner inside the fort. The room of our reception was
not much better than that we had left. We had, however, a capital
dinner, some cups of good tea, and a luxurious rest for the night, the
room having been heated with a good blazing fire and lots of smoke,
with no outlet for either, except the door and a small hole in the
roof.”&mdash;[<i>MS.</i>]</p>

 Captain Johnson says in his journal: “Both Mahomed Akbar and
his chiefs were most attentive in escorting over in safety the ladies and
their children and wounded Europeans.” There is other testimony to
the same effect: “Many of the ladies, being mounted on ponies, were
obliged to dismount and ride astride on the chargers of their Afghan
acquaintance, to avoid getting wet. Nothing could exceed the politeness
and attention of Mahomed Akbar on this occasion, who manifested
the greatest anxiety until all had crossed over in safety.”&mdash;[<i>Eyre’s
Rough Notes of Imprisonment in Afghanistan.</i>] “The chiefs gave
us every assistance. Mahomed Akbar Khan carried Mrs. Waller over
behind him on his own horse. One rode by me to keep my horse’s
head well up the stream. The Afghans made great exertions to save
both men and animals struggling in the water.”&mdash;[<i>Lady Sale’s

told to prepare for a march higher up the valley, and further removed
from Jellalabad, from which place Tugree is about thirty miles distant.
All our hopes, which we had entertained hitherto of being escorted to
Jellalabad, are now blighted, and we see plainly that we are nothing
more nor less than prisoners, until such time as General Sale shall
evacuate Jellalabad, or Dost Mahomed Khan be permitted by our
government to return to the country. Started at nine, and arrived at
Budeeabad, almost at the top of the valley, and close to the first range
of hills towards Kafiristan. It belongs to Mahomed Shah Khan, is
nearly new, and has a deep ditch and <i>fausse-braie</i> all round it. Our

 “Last night, Mahomed Akbar and I had a long conversation. He
was very anxious for the release of his father, and made many promises
in his name if we would release him. I pointed out that at least two
months must elapse before we could in any way have the instructions of
government regarding the release of the Ameer. I can see no objection
to the release of the Ameer, unless government intends making an
example of the city of Caubul. Our release and that of the hostages at
Caubul appears to depend upon his release. His family’s release
requires that of the women here. I wish for these last something could
be done; but I fear not. You must use your influence. They tell me
we shall be forwarded to Peshawur if you evacuate Jellalabad; and
the Sirdar begs me that I write you on the subject. I have explained
that I have no authority now, and said that I cannot promise anything
of the sort. I hope government will see nothing prejudicial to its
interests to release the Dost and family.”&mdash;[<i>Major Pottinger to Major

a bet with the latter of 1000 rupees that Dost Mahomed Khan, the
ex-Ameer, will be released by the 30th of January, and will return to
Afghanistan. The former gave 1000 rupees to be distributed among us
for the purpose of purchasing sugar and other little luxuries. My share
is fifty rupees; which sum is very acceptable, as I have not had a
pice about me since leaving Caubul.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s Narrative.

 It was dangerous to send military or political news in the ordinary
form of epistolary correspondence. So the officers at Jellalabad hit
upon the expedient of dotting off letters in old newspapers, so as to
form words and sentences&mdash;“an easy mode of carrying on secret correspondence
not likely to be detected by an Asiatic.” These dotted
letters communicated to the prisoners the tidings of Wild’s repulse in
the Khybur Pass&mdash;the despatch of General Pollock to Peshawur&mdash;and
the arrival of Dr. Brydon at Jellalabad.</p>

 The 1st of April was not forgotten. It is a curious proof of the
irrepressible love of practical joking which clings to our countrymen in
all places and in all situations, that the prisoners in Afghanistan, on
the 1st of April, turned their misfortunes into food for a joke. Captain
Johnson says: “<i>April 1, 1842.</i>&mdash;Was awakened early by M&mdash;&mdash;
telling me a letter had been received by L&mdash;&mdash; from Macgregor at
Jellalabad, informing him that our ransom had been effected for three
and a half lakhs of rupees, and that we were to start in five or six
days. Was up in an instant&mdash;off to L&mdash;&mdash;; and heard the story confirmed
by him. The report spread through the whole fort, among our
servants as well as the Europeans, in less than a minute. All was
intense delight; when, on its being a little sobered down, to my horror,
I was told that the story was all fudge. I was half mad with rage at
being made such an April fool of, on a subject which, of all others in
our situation, should have been the last for any of our party to have
expended his wit upon.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s Narrative of his Captivity.

 “Up to this date, Mirza Báudín Khan (who had saved Captain
Mackenzie’s life on the assassination of Sir William Macnaghten, and
who had previously to the breaking out of the insurrection informed
that officer of the advent of Akbar Khan at Bámian) had been the
keeper of the prison. This man was secretly well affected to the
English, and professed an especial friendship for Troup and Mackenzie,
to whom he immediately confided his intention of marching out with
the prisoners and his garrison (the majority of whom he had gained
over) to meet Sale’s troops as soon as he should hear of their proximity;
for he naturally expected that the General would have followed up his
decisive victory over Akbar by marching direct upon Badeeabad, distant
from Jellalabad not forty miles. As evening drew on, he became very
anxious, frequently visited the ramparts to look out for the British force,
and, passing over Sale as of no account in the matter, grievously abused
Macgregor for not coming to the rescue. This might have been very
easily accomplished, not only without risk, but with an effect on the
fortunes of Akbar and his party, which might have saved much subsequent
misery to the captives; expense, and bloodshed, in the advance
upon Caubul; and vacillation and moral cowardice in the councils of the
supreme government. But Sale came not, although the road was quite
open; and the following morning the friendly gaoler was deposed, and
his place taken by the Nazir or chief-steward of Mahomed Shah
Khan, whose insolence and brutality contrasted disagreeably with the
conduct of Báudín Khan.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Memorandum.</i>]</p>

 “<i>April 9.</i>&mdash;The whole of this day and yesterday passed in the
greatest suspense. Reports reached us to-day that the Sirdar and
Mahomed Shah Khan had arrived at the fort of the latter, about two
miles distant from us. The rout of the Afghan army appears to have
been perfect, and we hear that they have lost all their guns, camp-equipage,
and private property. All our guard appear very mysterious&mdash;group
together&mdash;and talk in whispers. The inhabitants of the fort
have removed their property and left their homes. Towards the afternoon,
several of our guard, with whom we had been in the habit of
conversing, and who had always been kind to us, on our asking them
what would become of us, would shake their heads and say, ‘You are in
the hands of God.’ A frightful stillness appeared to prevail. By
degrees we began to hear fearful rumours that we were all to be
massacred at sunset. Whether these first originated in the imaginations
of some of our party, or in those of the Afghans, I cannot say&mdash;but
knowing the revengeful temper of those in whose hands we were,
nothing appeared to us more probable; and our anxiety and suspense
increased as the day wore on. At about sunset a report was brought
in that Mahomed Shah Khan was on his way to visit us. Even this
was a relief to us, as we knew that what would happen to us must take
place shortly. In about ten minutes he arrived with a large party of
his followers. On coming up to us, our alarms were at an end as
concerned our lives, as he regarded us civilly, and shook hands with the
whole of us. We all sate down together. He entered slightly into the
defeat of the day before yesterday, and told us that we must be in
readiness to leave Budeeabad in the morning, without, however, giving
us any hint as to our destination; nor had any of us inclination to ask
questions of him. His will is law to us. After sitting for some time
he wished us ‘Good evening,’ and withdrew. He slept in the fort that
night, and we were busy making preparations for the morrow’s march.
These, however, were shortly at an end. All my worldly goods and
chattels might be stowed away in a towel or a handkerchief.”&mdash;[<i>Captain

 “<i>April 10.</i>&mdash;Up at daylight; had a cup of tea and was ready
for the march. Took out my saddle to put on my horse; found that
some rascal had stolen my stirrups. This was soon rectified by a piece
of rope. As I was about saddling my horse, which was a good Hissar-stud
animal, Mahomed Shah Khan sent a man to tell me that this was
to be his property, and that he would furnish me with some other beast,
as none of us were to be permitted to ride horses for fear of making our
escape.... In the mean time, Mahomed Shah Khan, having heard
that Lady Macnaghten was possessed of a great number of magnificent
shawls and valuable jewels, which she had been so lucky as to have
saved up to this time, went inside and coolly commanded her, without
sending any previous message, to open her boxes. These were all very
soon ransacked; and shawls and jewels to the amount of near two
lakhs of rupees were taken possession of by this chief of freebooters&mdash;politely
telling her ladyship that she might retain one or two shawls
and any particular jewel for which she might have more value than
another. Many of the little things were also taken possession of by a
young whelp&mdash;the worthy son of so worthy a sire. Remonstrance was
useless. About 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> we started; but still without the slightest
knowledge of where we were going.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s Narrative of

interment, to Jellalabad. The General’s faithful servant, Moore,
accompanied the body. “I have the honour to inform you,” wrote
Pottinger to Pollock, on the 26th of April, “that Mahomed Akbar
Khan yesterday despatched to you the body of the late Major-General
Elphinstone. It was, however, intercepted by a party of the Ghilzyes,
under the supposition that the Prince in Caubul had sent it, the party
made prisoners, and the European servant, who had been allowed to
accompany it, wounded. The savages, however, on hearing that
Mahomed Akbar Khan had sent it, deputed one of their number to
learn the truth. The Sirdar is much grieved at the accident, and now
sends a party, with Private Moore, the General’s servant, to replace the
corpse and forward it on. The Sirdar at present is unable to release
the two servants from the hostility of the intermediate clans; but he
promises to do so as soon as a person may arrive sufficiently powerful
to protect them.”&mdash;[<i>Major Pottinger to General Pollock: Castle of
Afzool Khan, Tezeen, April 26, 1842. MS. Records.</i>] The General’s
remains subsequently reached Jellalabad, and were interred with
military honours.</p>

 I am informed that one of Conolly’s inducements to visit Bokhara
was the hope of persuading Stoddart outwardly to recant his profession
of Mahomedanism. My informant, who was at this time at Caubul,
writes: “Arthur Conolly availed himself of a certain margin left him
in his instructions for visiting Kokund and Bokhara, to proceed to the
latter place, principally to obtain Stoddart’s release, and also with a
view to his restoration to that precious faith in a Divine Redeemer,
which he had outwardly denied. True it is, that He who cannot lie
has declared that whosoever denies Him before men, him will He deny
before God the Father; but, if ever an act of apostasy called for tears
of compassion, it is that of the martyr Stoddart, for he, too, like
Cranmer, died for the Faith which he once denied. Long before
Conolly’s arrival, the Ameer of Bokhara, who was accounted even by his
own countrymen an incarnation of perfidy and ferocity, had been led by
the contempt with which his letter to the Queen had been treated by
the Foreign Office, to wreak his vengeance on the only individual of the
offending nation in his power. By his order, Stoddart was kept in a
loathsome prison, frequently severely beaten, <i>which never extorted a
groan from him</i>, and starved into a state of pitiable weakness. Meanwhile,
he was repeatedly ordered to become a Mahomedan, which he
steadfastly refused to do. To conquer his obstinacy, the Ameer threw
him into the Chah-i-Seeah (or black pit), a place of torment for the
vilest criminals. It is such a pit as that into which Jeremiah was
cast, the bottom of it being composed of indescribable filth&mdash;men’s
bones, decomposed animal matter, &amp;c. In it, amongst other vermin,
are large ticks, which bury themselves in the flesh of the victim, producing
noisome sores. Before life was extinct, Stoddart was drawn up
from this horrible dungeon, and, on reviving somewhat, was exposed in
one of the great gates of the city, all who entered being instructed to
spit in his face and buffet him. Still he refused to abjure Christianity.
The next day he was again severely beaten, his grave dug before his
face, and it was announced to him that, unless he pronounced the
Mahomedan confession of faith, in that very grave he would forthwith
be buried alive. Hitherto, this noble gentleman’s resolution had not
failed him; but in this fearful moment of temptation, when <i>mere</i>
human nature could sustain no more, to use his own expression,&mdash;‘The
grating of the spades against the sides of the grave jarred on his shattered
nerves beyond endurance.’ Certain Mahomedans, whose sympathy
had been enlisted by his noble constancy, besought him almost with
tears to spare them the disgrace of his murder, and to pronounce the
confession as a mere matter of form; and thus, almost unconsciously,
he with his mouth owned the Arabian impostor as the true Prophet of
God. Arthur Conolly’s arrival, exhortations, and prayers speedily
produced the blessed effect aimed at. Stoddart renounced Mahomedanism
(having previously refused to live with the wife assigned him
as a new convert), and thus subjected himself to a new series of cruelties
and indignities which, as we have seen, ended in his and Conolly’s
public martyrdom.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Memorandum.</i>]</p>

 In July, Stoddart wrote to Major Rawlinson, saying: “Conolly is
not yet here from Kokund, nor have my messengers to him yet returned.
They conveyed the orders from Caubul, and an invitation from the
Ameer to return by this route.”&mdash;[<i>MS.</i>]</p>

 “The Ameer was very much enraged at finding that the Queen
had not answered his letter; but had referred Colonel Stoddart to the
Indian Government, for all matters connected with Bokhara. About
five days after this, intelligence was received that Sir Alexander Burnes
had been murdered at Caubul. On the receipt of this intelligence a
servant of the Ameer was sent to call the two gentlemen to his presence.
The Ameer asked Colonel Stoddart which road he could now take, even
supposing he (the Ameer) was willing to release him. The Colonel said
he could go either by Russia or Persia. The Ameer said he would
release him in seven or eight days, and keep Captain Conolly. A few
days afterwards the English gentlemen were sent for to the palace and
confined.”&mdash;[<i>Statement of Shah Mahomed, Populzye, one of Captain
Conolly’s attendants. MS. Records.</i>] This part of the statement is
entirely confirmed by that of Saleh Mahomed, Akhondzadeh, as taken
by Colonel Sheil.</p>

 Allahdad Khan, the Afghan envoy, who accompanied Captain
Conolly, had been permitted to take his departure from Bokhara, but
was afterwards brought back and confined. He remained for some
days in the same apartment with Stoddart and Conolly, but was subsequently
removed to other quarters. The servants of the latter officer
were also thrown into prison&mdash;some of them into the well, or log-house,
in which Stoddart had been incarcerated.</p>

 <i>Arthur Conolly’s MS. Journal.</i>&mdash;A Russian Mission was then at
Bokhara, under the charge of Colonel Boutenoff, who seems to have
been in higher favour than the English gentlemen; and to have greatly
pitied their condition. On the 15th of February the prisoners despatched
a letter to him by the hands of one of their dependents known as Long
Joseph, whose exploits are thus recorded:</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>February 15.</i>&mdash;This day Long Joseph gallantly darted into our
room, and carried off a note which we had written for Colonel Boutenoff,
to inform him of our situation.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>February 16.</i>&mdash;Long Joseph having won a servant of the Topshee-Bashee’s,
conveyed to us a note from the gaoler, and sent it to him;
Stoddart writing to government through Sir J. M’Neill.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Colonel Stoddart had interchanged visits with the Russians before
Conolly’s arrival. Saleh Mahomed says: “There was an ambassador
at this time from the Russian Government who came twice to see the
English gentlemen, who also visited him.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 <i>MS. Correspondence.</i>&mdash;Arthur Conolly was painfully anxious to
remove from the minds of his friends the impression which might have
been produced upon them by his letter of the 11th of March. Again he
wrote in his journal-letter: “I take this opportunity of explaining that
my letter of the 11th of March was written when I was very ill with
fever. Thinking that he might forcibly be sent away from me on the
departure of the Russians (as they brought a request for his dismissal),
or that we might be otherwise separated, Stoddart had begged me to
give him a memorandum of my opinions regarding the policy to be pursued
towards these states; and I wrote off a hasty summary of these
notions, which were running in my head, with many things that I was
anxious to say about my unfortunate servants, and to my friends, when
under excitement, which must have made my expressions very wild
and incoherent. I hoped that the paper containing them remained in
the hands of Long Joseph; but he, misunderstanding our instructions,
instead of keeping it, gave it to Eusofee-i-Roomee (Augustin), who,
apparently, went off at once with it to Caubul. When I got better I
drew up for Stoddart the memorandum which he had asked for, and
which he now decides on forwarding. It is written in a more calm and
less indignant tone than the letter aforesaid, but allowance must be
made for the brevity and freedom of the propositions, for we were so
liable to be interrupted and discovered, that I could only pen my
opinions by snatches, and paper is a scarce article with us.”&mdash;[<i>Arthur

 General Pollock exerted himself to obtain an adjustment of the
claims of Captain Conolly’s servants; and he succeeded. The letter
which was written in reply to Pollock’s application shows in what light
Lord Ellenborough regarded Conolly’s mission: “With reference,”
wrote the Chief Secretary, “to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, on the
subject of the remuneration applied for, on behalf of the servants
attached to the mission of Lieutenant A. Conolly to Kokund, I am
directed to inform you that the Governor-General has no knowledge of
Lieutenant A. Conolly’s mission to Kokund having been authorised. On
the contrary, his Lordship was informed, by the late President of the
Board of Control, that Lieutenant A. Conolly was expressly instructed
by him not to go to Kokund; and, in all probability, he owes all his
misfortunes to his direct transgression of that instruction. The servants
entertained by him, however, are not responsible for the indiscretion
of their master. They were in the service of an officer apparently
employed on a public mission by his government, and the Governor-General
is prepared to consider their position favourably. His Lordship,
therefore, authorises the disbursement of the sums stated in the
papers attached to your letter, under reply to be due to these several
persons; but the sums so paid on account of wages accruing to these
several persons, after they left Khiva (after deducting therefrom the
amount of wages which would have become due during a direct march
to Caubul) will be made a charge against Lieutenant A. Conolly, who
will be required to refund the amount, as well as all sums which may
have been drawn on account of such an unauthorised extension of his
mission.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. Maddock to General Pollock: Simlah, Nov. 3, 1842.

 An abstract of this letter was forwarded by another route, and it
reached John Conolly at Caubul on the 4th of July. In this letter,
Stoddart reports the success of the Ameer at Kokund. “The Ameer,”
he wrote, “entered Kokund on the 11th of May, and gave it up to
pillage&mdash;destroyed its rulers&mdash;unpeopled its capital, and is now on his
return, having distributed the different governments among his own
Bokharan chiefs. He is become master of immense treasure, and will
now probably march against Khiva, which, unless saved by some
demonstration from Persia or Afghanistan, must fall in August or
September, after a short campaign.” With reference to the efforts of
the Russian Mission, he says: “The Russian Mission left this towards
the end of April. I feel convinced that Colonel Boutenoff’s kind desire
to procure our release failed solely in consequence of the unreasonableness
of the Ameer.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 General Pollock officially reported Captain Conolly’s death from
Caubul, in a letter dated September 30; but he added: “The only
authority for the death of this very intelligent officer is conveyed in a
Persian letter from a native of Caubul, who writes from Bokhara to
Moollah Ahmed Khan, of this city, saying, ‘Tell Moostafah (Captain
A. C.’s servant) that his uncle, whom he left here sick, saying he was
a great traveller and had visited Kokund, was taken very ill, and
though we gave him medicine and did all in our power, it was of no
avail. It was the will of God that he should die.’ Moostafah and
Moollah Ahmed Khan are both of opinion that Captain A. Conolly is
the person alluded to, and as the letter proceeds to say that the effects
of the deceased are at Bokhara, and can be sent when required; and as
Moostafah had no uncle, to whom could the description apply? I fear
there can be no reason to doubt the death of the above-named officer.
Colonel Stoddart is, from native report, said to be alive, and still in
confinement.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] This is mere conjecture; and by no
means tallies with the more credible account of the execution of the two
prisoners. On the 3rd of November, 1842, the Supreme Government
assumed that Conolly was still alive. But the home authorities
adopted Saleh Mahomed’s story, and struck Stoddart’s name out of the
army list, from the 17th of June, 1842. I believe this really to have
been the date of their deaths. Major Rawlinson, on the morning of the
16th of September, 1842, met one of Stoddart’s servants near Caubul,
and the man whom he knew, informed him that he had come direct
from Bokhara, having started immediately after the execution of his
master.&mdash;[<i>MS. Notes.</i>] The reader may consult the works of Captain
Grover and Dr. Wolff.</p>

 <i>Colonel Stoddart to Major Rawlinson: Bokhara, July 7, 1841.
MS. Correspondence.</i> It may be gathered from this letter that
Stoddart had no intention of awaiting Conolly’s arrival at Bokhara;
and that Conolly proceeded thither under orders from Caubul, and an
invitation from the Ameer. An attempt has been made to control, in
some measure, the flood of sympathy which sets in so strongly towards
Arthur Conolly, by asserting that he was not authorised to proceed even
as far as Kokund, and that he therefore brought his misfortunes down
upon his own head. But I have before me the strongest proof that
Conolly <i>was</i> authorised by the Supreme Government to proceed to
Kokund, and to use his best endeavours to obtain the liberation of
Colonel Stoddart. In a letter, an official copy of which is now before
me, the Chief Secretary writes to the Envoy and Minister: “As in the
present aspect of affairs it does not seem necessary to continue the
restriction which had at first been imposed, his Lordship in Council
authorises you to permit Captain Conolly to proceed from Khiva to
Kokund, if he should think it expedient, and if he finds that he can do
so without exciting serious distrust and jealousy at the former place.
In his personal intercourse with the Khan of Kokund, he will be
guided by the instructions which have been issued, prescribing the
purport of his written communications. Captain Conolly may, in such
a journey, find increased means of using an useful influence at Bokhara
for the release of Colonel Stoddart; and his Lordship in Council need
not add, that he would wish every such means to be employed with the
utmost earnestness and diligence for that purpose.”&mdash;[<i>Mr. Maddock

 Two other notes were written by the prisoners on the back of this
paper: one to Miss Stoddart at Norwich, and the other to John Conolly
at Caubul. “Don’t believe all you hear or may hear,” wrote Stoddart.
“Keep all friends informed of my health, and don’t let them be disturbed

 On the 5th of May, Mohun Lal wrote: “The Prince (Futteh
Jung) is very, very anxious that the General should march to Caubul;
he appears now involved in difficulties, and undoubtedly is friendly to
our government. He says he would not allow Ameen-oollah and the
Populzye rebels to come into the palace, the evening they were obliged
to leave the city, but by allowing them to come in, he entertained two
objects. Firstly, to employ their services against the enemies of both
states (the Barukzyes, who murdered the Envoy and also his father,
the King, placed by the English Government on the throne) till the
arrival of General Pollock. Secondly, he may keep them quietly in his

 “The Prince,” said Mohun Lal, “is of course very liberal to those
that espouse his cause, while the Barukzyes pay very little by selling
jewels and finery. The Kohistanees or disciples of Meer Hadjee are
towards the Barukzyes; but they groan to receive money lesser than

 “Khan Shereen Khan,” wrote Mohun Lal, on the 9th of May,
“came last night to me and said, that the Barukzyes press upon him
to side with them to oppose the Prince; and if he does agree he is sure
he will be ruined. He says he is going to send his wives to some of the
country forts, and then either go into the Balla Hissar or wait upon
you at Jellalabad; and then he thinks that the whole of the Persians
will follow him.”&mdash;And again, on May 10th: “Yesterday, about
noon, ... Mahomed Akbar Khan came in person to Khan Shereen
Khan, and persuaded him, after a long talk, to side with him to oppose
the Prince towards Benee Hissar. When Mahomed Zemaun Khan
heard this he got jealous, and sent a message to Khan Shereen Khan,
if he did not go himself or send his son to assist Soojah-ool-Dowlah, as
the Newab had requested him, he had better not go, with Mahomed
Akbar too. The latter at last succeeded.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 “When Mahomed Akbar,” wrote Mohun Lal, “appeared in the
field opposite the first or distant fort, Abdul Salem became traitor, and
waited on Mahomed Akbar, who gave him a horse and desired him to
go to his village. Upon this the people of the Prince, who were
stationed in the forts between the fort of Abdul Salem and Balla Hissar,
became disheartened and cowardly, obliged to desert the forts without
fighting, and fly to the Balla Hissar. Mahomed Akbar’s people followed
the fugitives to the very gates of the Balla Hissar, and possessed
the gun of the Prince. Mahomed Akbar had taken Major Pottinger
also with him to the fight.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 According, however, to our English notions, the contest was very
far from a vigorous one. John Conolly wrote from Caubul: “The
contending parties continue to amuse themselves with firing long shots
with their guns and jezails, and the Balla Boorj is attacked&mdash;that is,
fired at for three or four hours by one or two thousand men every third
night or so.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>] Conolly says, in the same
letter: “There is an anecdote here, that three Feringhees arrived at
the Balla Hissar in disguise, and that on hearing this the Barukzyes
withdrew their outposts to a considerable distance.” In another letter
(May 26) he says: “The Prince holds out still in the citadel. The
Barukzyes have been battering at the Upper Boorj, and firing into the
Balla Hissar. According to our ideas, their efforts have been almost

be glad to see relief.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 The Prince had no powder. Mohun Lal, however, contrived to
procure some and to convey it to the Balla Hissar, through the agency
of the Kuzzilbash chiefs.</p>

 On the 5th of June, Mohun Lal wrote to Sir R. Shakespear,
Pollock’s military secretary: “If you will not march immediately, or
in four days, to Gundamuck, you will lose all your prisoners, and the
Barukzyes will possess the riches of the late Shah, as well as the Balla
Hissar and the artillery.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] John Conolly’s letters,
written about this time, contain the same urgent exhortations to
advance, as the only means of saving the Balla Hissar and the prisoners.</p>

 The mine was altogether the merest bug-bear. It frightened the
Prince and the garrison; but Mohun Lal assured the former that it
could not by any possibility do him any harm, as it had not been
properly dug, nor run sufficiently far under the works to damage them,
even if the strength of the masonry were not such as to bid defiance to
the attempt.</p>

 <i>Correspondence of Mohun Lal. MS. Records.</i> Futteh Jung
continued to write to the British authorities that he had little or no
money; and that if the British did not advance, the royal family would
be ruined and disgraced. “It is well known to you,” he wrote to
General Pollock, “that Mahomed Akbar has made peace, with the
view to derive wealth from me; but I know that I have none. If I
could sell everything that I possess, I should not be able to raise a lakh
of rupees.”</p>

 The Newab had little money; but the most valuable jewels of
Shah Soojah were in his possession. The Shah was wont to carry them
about with him in a bag; and he had them in his possession at the
time of his murder. “Mahomed Zemaun Khan,” wrote Mohun Lal to
Sir Richmond Shakespear, “has got hold of the most valuable jewels of
the late King, who, report said, had them thrown into a ditch when
Soojah-ood-Dowlah murdered him. This was seen by an Afghan at a
distance, who after some days went to the place and took out the small
bag of jewels, which he, being ignorant of their worth, sold them for
600 rupees. This was reported to the Newab, who imprisoned the
bidders and got all the jewels from them. The bankers say that they
are worth 50 lakhs of rupees, but here are no men to purchase them.”&mdash;[<i>MS.
Records.</i>] Akbar Khan had contrived to extract a considerable
sum of money from the Prince. On the 17th of June, Mohun Lal
reported that the Sirdar had received a lakh and a half of rupees from
the royal treasury. On the 18th, John Conolly wrote that the Sirdar
had drawn two lakhs, adding: “He has taken an inventory of all the
property and treasure in the citadel; and has his own men there.”
“It will be a great consolation to us all,” he wrote in conclusion, “if
you will tell us that no negotiations beyond the ransom of the prisoners
will ever be entered into with Akbar. He is certainly the most
uncompromising villain that ever lived.”&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant Conolly to

 “The Prince was seated on the throne on the 29th. Akbar
constituted himself prime minister of all Afghans. The Hindostanee
dependents on the Prince had been previously removed from the Balla
Hissar, and none but his immediate attendants were allowed to remain&mdash;the
garrison being composed of Akbar’s own soldiers. The remnant
of the royal jewels, treasure, and property, even to a few silver cooking
utensils, had been also made over to Akbar. It was Akbar’s intention
to have deposed the Prince; and several meetings were convened to
discuss the question. The resolution to crown the Prince was sudden,
and suggested by an idea that the Populzyes who had connected themselves
with Timour at Candahar might be induced to recognise the
present arrangements in a preference to a Suddozye King under British
auspices.”&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant J. B. Conolly to Sir Richmond Shakespear:

 All the circumstances attending their surrender ought to be
related. The incident is thus feelingly chronicled by Captain Johnson:
“Two days after the death of Shah Soojah, the people of Caubul
demanded that our hostages, who had been left under charge of
Mahomed Zemaun Khan, should be given up to the care of the son
of the late High Priest, Meer Hadjee. The former noble-hearted
gentleman, than whom no father could have behaved more tenderly to
his children, begged and entreated with tears that the separation should
not take place&mdash;adding that he was willing to give up his own family to
the popular will, but not the English gentlemen who had been entrusted
to his care, and who were his honoured guests&mdash;that he would, if the
people so willed it, make over to them his own son, with his sword
round his neck, and his turban for a winding-sheet, to be dealt with
according to their pleasure; but that force alone should deprive him of
the society of his friends. When all entreaties failed, he hoped to
work upon the feelings of the party at the conference by telling them
that their chief and his own sister and relations were in the hands of
the British Government, and that vengeance would assuredly be dealt
upon them if the English gentlemen sustained the slightest injury. On
this, a grey-bearded old gentleman told him and the rest that they
might make their minds perfectly easy as regarded the Afghan
prisoners in India, as it was contrary to the uses of Englishmen to
hurt a hair of the heads of their captives. The clamour of the people
prevailed over all that the Newab could urge, and with many a bitter
feeling did this amiable man make over the hostages to Meer Hadjee,
with prayers and entreaties to the latter that he would behave kindly
to them; and at the same time he sent with them to the latter’s
house all the females of his family, as the surest means of their protection;
for however excited a Mussulman population may be, it is
seldom or ever that they violate a harem.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s
MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 Mohun Lal’s own account of his sufferings is worth quoting: “I
have the honour to address you, for the information of Major-General
Pollock, C.B., that Akbar Khan, on the night of the 11th inst. (July),
put me in charge of Moollah Said, Atchekzye, in whose house I was
forced to lay down, and a couch placed over me, on which the people
jumped, and are beating me with sticks in a very unmerciful manner.
Akbar wants 30,000 rupees from me&mdash;says, otherwise, that he will
pull out my eyes. All my body has been severely beaten. I cannot
promise anything without government’s order, but see myself destroyed....
All my feet is wounded by bastinadoing.”&mdash;[<i>Mohun Lal to Sir
R. Shakespear: July 14, 1842. MS. Records.</i>] “I suffer very
much. Sometimes I am pinioned and a heavy stone is placed on my
back, whilst the red pepper is burnt before my nose and eyes. Sometimes
I am bastinadoed. In short, I suffer every conceivable agony.
He wants 30,000 rupees, out of which he has hitherto got 12,000,
after using me very rudely. The remainder, if not paid in the course
of ten days, he says he will pull out my eyes, and burn my body
with a hot iron.”&mdash;[<i>Mohun Lal to Sir R. Shakespear: July 17. MS.
Records.</i>]</p>

 The cause of this hasty removal is to be found in Akbar’s suspicions
that the Jabbar Khail, the most powerful of the western Ghilzye
clans, intended to carry off the prisoners and sell them to General
Pollock on their own account. This plot really existed, and had been
suggested to the chiefs of the Jabbar Khail by Captain Mackenzie
during his journeys to and from Jellalabad.</p>

 They were turned out of the fort, indeed, to make room for the
prisoners, to the infinite annoyance of the unhappy chief, who made
every possible excuse for not receiving them, but was overruled by
Akbar Khan, who obtained admittance for them, in the first instance,
on the plea that he only required accommodation for the night, and
then urged that the fort would suit them better than any other place
in the neighbourhood. It was altogether a most unfortunate occurrence
for Ali Mahomed, as, subsequently, on the advance of the British, the
fort was levelled with the ground, and the garden destroyed.</p>

 “I attach much weight,” wrote Lord Ellenborough, at the end of
May, “to what Major Sleeman says of the disposition of the Mahomedans;
but I am surprised that it has not occurred to him and to others, that
whatever may be the disposition of the Mahomedans, it is the absence,
not the presence of our troops, of whom more than three-fourths are
Hindoos, that alone can lead the Mahomedans to act against us. The
danger is in the position of the army, almost without communication
with India, too far off to return quickly at any season, unable from the
season to return now, without adequate supplies of food or carriage.
This is the danger which all the great statesmen in India would perpetuate
if they could, and while they maintain it, destroy the confidence
of the Sepoy and ruin our finances. <i>If I save this country, I shall
save it in spite of every man in it who ought to give me support, but I
will save it in spite of them all.</i>”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 Some readers, not having maps before them, will better understand
the nature of this retirement if I liken it to the case of a man
wishing to retire from Reigate to London, and taking Dover and Canterbury
in his way.</p>

 The services rendered by Mr. Robertson to his country, at this
time, have never been adequately acknowledged, except by General
Pollock himself, who never lost an opportunity of expressing his gratitude
for the assistance he had derived from the exertions of the
Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. Mr. Robertson,
aware of the difficulty of collecting camels in sufficient number for the
purposes of the army, ordered letters to be addressed to the principal
collectors in Upper India, calling upon them to purchase as many
ponies and mules as they could get together in their several districts.
And it was in no small measure owing to these exertions that Pollock
was at length enabled to advance.</p>

 “If I have not,” wrote Pollock, “lived long enough to judge of
the propriety of an act for which I alone am responsible, the sooner I
resign the command as unfit the better. I assure you that I feel the
full benefit of being unshackled and allowed to judge for myself.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

 A letter, too, was sent by Captain Troup to Akbar Khan with a
request that he would forward it to Nott. A few harmless lines were
written in ink; and much important matter in rice-water, to be brought
out by the application of iodine. The employment of Akbar Khan
himself, as the medium of communication between the two Generals,
who were contemplating his destruction, is not one of the least amusing
incidents of the war.</p>

 Pollock was afraid that Nott would have commenced his retreat
before the receipt of the despatch of July 4. “My movement will of
course depend,” he wrote in a confidential letter to Mr. Robertson on
the 10th of August, “on General Nott’s ability to meet me. Our late
accounts from that quarter are not favourable. They say that General
Nott is bent on retiring, and I very much fear that he will have made
several marches to the rear before the government despatch can reach
him.... I ought by this time to have heard from General Nott, in
reply to my letter by the first of the five messengers. If he is not
coming on, my negotiations for the prisoners will be a very simple
affair; but it must ever be a subject of regret that he should so hastily
retire, and at such a time, while he commands an army in every
respect efficient, and amounting to about 15,000 men.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 It was reported in camp, and subsequently set forth in the local
journals, that some women had been violated by our soldiery. “But,”
says Captain Macgregor, “I made the strictest inquiry into the matter,
both from the Afghan chiefs who were with me, and from the
inhabitants of the village, but could not trace in the slightest degree
any just foundation for the report in question. Had there been any, it
would doubtless have formed a subject of great grievance to the people,
who are so very jealous of the honour of their women.”&mdash;[<i>Captain

 There was no need to cut them down. It was sufficient to cut deep
rings through the bark to the heart of the tree; for they seldom survived
the operation. There is something in this so repugnant to our
civilised and Christian ideas of righteous retribution, that it is only
just that I should give in this place the explanation of an act, perpetrated,
indeed, upon other occasions, in the words of an officer equally
gallant and humane. “All the injury,” said Captain Macgregor,
“that we could do to their forts and houses could, with facility, in a
short time be repaired by them. From their proximity to the hills,
they could always obtain timber in abundance; and where water is
plentiful they could rebuild easily the bastions we might blow up; and
therefore a greater degree of punishment than this seemed to be necessary,
and was completely within our power, if we destroyed their trees&mdash;a
measure which seems barbarous to a civilised mind; but in no other
way can the Afghans be made to feel equally the weight of our power,
for they delight in the shade of their trees. They are to be seen under
them in groups, during the summer, all day long, talking, reading,
weaving, and sleeping. Even women and children seek the shade of
their trees. The Afghan mountaineer is not tangible to us in any other
way. He removes his herds, flocks, and property to the hills on the
shortest notice; and flies before our troops to places where he is inaccessible
to them. The Goolai people, moreover, were deserving of no
mercy. The amount of treasure they had plundered (viz., 18,000 or
20,000 rupees) was considerable. They had been very pertinacious in
attacking Captain Ferris’s cantonment; and equally so, subsequently,
our troops at Jellalabad. Therefore the Brigadier determined at once
to commence the work of destruction, desired that neither fort, house,
tree, grain, nor <i>boosa</i> should be spared to them. This assuredly was
the best plan for preventing the necessity of harsh measures in future.
Working parties from the brigade were accordingly appointed for this
purpose.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Macgregor’s Report. MS. Records.</i>]</p>

 “It is impossible,” wrote General Pollock, “to guess how this
mission may succeed, because, in dealing with Afghans, you deal with
treachery and deceit; but appearances are as fair as they can be for
the release of the prisoners. Captain Troup says that if it had depended
on Mahomed Akbar alone, some of the ladies would have been sent
with him; but Mahomed Shah appears to be a bitter enemy of ours&mdash;much
more so than I had reason to suppose. The man who has come
with Captain Troup was selected in opposition to the wish of Mahomed
Akbar, who wished to send Dost Mahomed Khan, a brother of Mahomed
Shah. Dost Mahomed was objected to by the chiefs as being too
bigoted to his own party, whereas Hadjee Buktear Khan was considered
neutral. He is a Candahar man&mdash;has been at Bombay and others of
our settlements, and is better acquainted with the European character
than the other.”&mdash;[<i>Jellalabad, July 15. MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 “Captain Troup,” wrote General Pollock, “is still here. I am
glad that, in proposing terms, I insisted on having the guns, for I think
there is almost a certainty of an objection being made to that, in which
case, of course, I can back out.... On this occasion I have written

 “I have my camp in two lines,” he wrote a few days afterwards
to Pollock, “the cavalry facing the river, and rear to the water&mdash;the

 The Governor-General, however, seems to have considered it not
wholly improbable that the contemplated military movement upon
Caubul would be suspended by the favourable conclusion of the negotiations
with the enemy; and actually authorised Pollock to exercise
his discretion in ordering Nott to retire by Quettah, even though the
march upon Ghuznee and Caubul had been commenced.&mdash;[<i>Lord Ellenborough
to General Pollock: July 29, 1842.</i>] Subsequently the
Governor-General seemed to awaken to a sense of the extraordinary
character of this suggestion, for he wrote to General Pollock to say that
he “could hardly imagine the existence of circumstances which could
justify the diversion of Major-General Nott’s army from the route of
Ghuznee and of Caubul, when his intention of marching by that route
shall have been once clearly indicated.”&mdash;[<i>Lord Ellenborough to

 Akbar Khan compelled the Prince to write to Pollock: “I have
given to Sirdar Mahomed Akbar the full and entire management of all
my property and affairs of every description, and have resigned to him
in perpetuity full power to judge and settle all questions on all points.
Whatever arrangement he may make with the English Government I
agree to confirm, and no alteration shall be made.” And again: “The
arrangements which have been made with Captain Troup and Hadjee
Buktear have been all approved of by me. I have delegated all powers
over my country and wealth to the Wuzeer, Mahomed Akbar Khan,
Barukzye!” But the Prince took the first opportunity to write
privately to the General: “My friend, it will have been evident to you
that in this matter I have been compelled to act thus. I did not even
know that Captain Troup and Hadjee Buktear had been sent, and I
had not the slightest knowledge of the proposals made by them.
Captain Troup is well aware of this, since we had never met, nor had
any of my confidential people been employed between us.”&mdash;[<i>Futteh
Jung to General Pollock: Translation. July 21, 1842. MS. Records.</i>]
This letter was evidently written in a state of painful alarm. It concludes
with the words: “You must be very careful not to let it be
known that I have written to you; since, should these villains hear of
it, they would put me and my family to death.” In reply to this
letter, Pollock expressed his surprise that, “notwithstanding his
Majesty’s friendship, the good-will of the chiefs, and the unanimity of
the people at Caubul, still they cannot prevent the treachery of one
man from causing dissension between the two governments, and that
they are unable to show their good-will to us by releasing our prisoners.”
To this, on the 1st of August, Futteh Jung replied: “You express
surprise at my many well-wishers not being able to find a remedy for
one evil-disposed person. You write: ‘If this could be effected, a
great object would be obtained.’ Eminent in rank! You write truly.
But in a religious war, a father cannot trust his son&mdash;a son, his
father.”</p>

 In consequence of this act, Aga Mahomed became a marked man.
His father was assassinated, and he and his brother cut down by order
of Akbar. Being ruined, he found his way to Hindostan, and became
the guest of an English officer, who obtained from the Government a
pension of twelve rupees a month for him. He served on the late
expedition to Bushire, and died leaving a helpless widow, like himself,
a convert to Christianity.</p>

 Captains Troup and Bygrave, when the other prisoners were sent
to Bameean, had been taken by Akbar Khan to the Balla Hissar&mdash;but
had subsequently been permitted to remove themselves to Ali Mahomed’s

 Nothing could have been better than the conduct of the troops
throughout the whole of these operations. “I think no officer,” wrote
Pollock, in a private letter, on the 23rd of September, “could possibly
have had finer regiments under his command than I have had, and to
them do I owe all my success, which, as far as I am able to judge, has
been so far complete. I hope the Governor-General may think so, and
I shall be satisfied.” In this letter, the difficulties with which Pollock
had to contend, from the scarcity of cattle, are thus detailed. “I
have had,” he wrote, “great difficulties to contend against even to the
last, from the great want of carriage-cattle. At Gundamuck, after my
first engagement with the enemy, I found myself so reduced in cattle,
that, to enable me to take on only fourteen days’ supplies, I was
obliged to leave at that place two horse-artillery guns, two squadrons
of cavalry, and two wings of Native infantry; and yet with all this, all
the camp-followers, public and private, were compelled to carry eight
days’ supplies. The fighting men carried three. The 1st Cavalry
carried eight days’ supplies on their horses. The rest of the cavalry
carried three or four days’. In this way we were enabled to move....
The night before I left Gundamuck, I received an official letter and a
survey report, setting forth that the whole of the camels of one regiment
were unserviceable, and that they could not get up even without
their loads. This was rather provoking, for I have only three Native
regiments with me. My answer was short. ‘Tell the commanding
officer, that if his regiment can’t march, he will relieve the two wings
ordered to remain behind, and who are willing to go forward on any
terms.’ The regiment marched, and I heard no more about their
camels. After our last engagement with the enemy (it was a severe
struggle) we had 160 killed and wounded; and again carriage was in
requisition. The spare horses of the cavalry were had recourse to;
and I lent my own riding-horse to one poor fellow.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

 “The view from the look-out in the city,” wrote Rawlinson in his
journal, “was now very fine. The hillocks on the right were crowned
with masses of horsemen, numbering apparently about 1500&mdash;a crowd
of footmen occupied the rocky heights in front of our line and beyond,
the shoulder of the Peer-Paee-Mal hill was covered with human beings
thick as a flight of locusts, bodies of horse continually debouching
round the shoulder and pushing on to join their comrades on the right.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 Nott, in his public despatches, was always somewhat chary of his
praise, but in his private letters he delighted to dwell upon the achievements
of his Sepoy regiments. Writing to Hammersley about this
affair of the 29th of May, he said: “You will hear enough of our
affair of the 29th with the enemy. The troops behaved well, and I am
really surprised that our loss was so trifling; but I have remarked
that the Afghans fire high. Our Sepoys are noble fellows&mdash;1000 are
fully equal to 5000 Afghans or more. A detail of the 1st Cavalry,
under Chamberlaine, behaved very well indeed. The enemy had 8000
men in position and 2000 in reserve. We had 1500 of all arms in the
field. The enemy have broken up. I expect Wymer back in a day or
two, when I will drive the rebels out of the Candahar district. How I
should like to go to Caubul! It is wonderful that the people in
Hindostan should be so panic-struck; and they seem to believe that
our Sepoys cannot stand the Afghans. Now, I am quite sure, and
should like to try it to-morrow, that 5000 Bengal Sepoys would lick
25,000 Afghans.”&mdash;[<i>General Nott to Lieutenant Hammersley: June 2,

 It is said that the widow of Akrum Khan, who was executed at
Candahar in the preceding autumn, was in the field, riding her husband’s
charger, and bearing a Ghazee standard. Lieutenant Rattray
writes: “As the enemy drew near, a white object was observed in the
centre of their front ranks, which seemed the rallying-point for the
Ghazees, chieftains, Moollahs, kettle-drums, and standard-bearers.
This proved to be no less a personage than the heroic widow of the
slaughtered Akrum Khan. Throwing aside her timid nature with her
‘Boorkha,’ she had left the sacred privacy of the Zenana for the foremost
rank in the battle-field, had bestrode her husband’s charger, and
with his standard in her hand had assembled the tribes.”</p>

 <i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i> It appears that early in June
the enemy’s suspicions of our intended withdrawal were confirmed in a
curious manner, and that they seemed then to think of terms. Rawlinson
says: “It appears that when the entire party of the Douranee
chiefs were on the point of dissolution, a Hindostanee deserter joined
the camp from the town, saying that he and his comrades had received
letters from India, stating positively that orders had been sent up for
our retirement. The man, in fact, explained in detail all our plans&mdash;the
abandonment and destruction of Khelat&mdash;the march of the brigade
to bring up camels from Quettah&mdash;and he even asserted that we were
preparing to destroy the four corner bastions of the city and the gateways,
and that we should leave in a month hence. This decided the
chiefs on dropping their offers of accommodation, and holding on until
events became more developed.”</p>

 It is to be borne in mind that the supreme political authority had
been vested by the Indian Government in the General. Nott, however,
was not inclined to interfere in the political management of affairs, and
Rawlinson continued to conduct them very much as he had done before
the order was issued; but he referred all important questions to the
General, who, for the most part, deferred to the opinions of his more
experienced political associate.</p>

 “The particular object to be gained by adopting this latter route
it was difficult to divine, and the generally-received impression among
the officers&mdash;perhaps because the one most desired&mdash;was that our
General was to lead us on to Caubul, and that the mention of Dehra
Ismael Khan was merely to throw dust in the eyes of the natives.
Indeed, it was afterwards accounted for, whether justly or not, by this
fact, that if the Lohaunies, upon whom we were dependent for a large
proportion of our camels, had had an idea that our intention was to
have marched on Ghuznee and Caubul, they would have declined
accompanying our army.”&mdash;[<i>Neill’s Recollections.</i>]</p>

 “The General first learnt of what was going on about two o’clock,
when an orderly came back from Captain Delamain reporting that no
enemy was in sight, and asking for orders. The General immediately
ordered the troops back. Shortly afterwards Lieutenant Brett galloped
in, saying that about 2000 of the enemy had appeared in front of
Captain Delamain, and were too strongly posted on some rising ground
to be attacked. The General again ordered the troops back. A third
orderly came galloping, to say the cavalry were engaged; and very
shortly afterwards other men came from the field, declaring our Horse
to be annihilated. The General now went out with all the troops, for
the enemy’s force was reported to be above 7000, and we expected them
to be flushed with their success. The horse artillery reached first, and
Leslie took the command. We came up shortly afterwards, and found
the cavalry still in a body, but having evidently suffered a defeat.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 “The General now turned down to some forts, from which some
shots were reported to have been fired. The villagers all came out
with Korans and ropes round their necks, praying for quarter. The
General granted quarter, but sent in the light company of the 40th to
search the houses. A shot was fired from some Ghazee in the place,
and orders were then given for an indiscriminate massacre. The
women and children were spared, but I suppose 100 of the villagers
were butchered. I do not think the men were to blame&mdash;had they
supposed themselves committed, they would have fled to the hills before
the troops moved out, but no doubt there were <i>Ghazees</i> in the place,
desperate men who had no wish to save their own lives, provided they
could destroy an infidel, and to the infatuation of these few men were
the others sacrificed. Five Commissariat camels were found inside, so
that parties in the fort had certainly been plundering; and as we
approached the place, I remarked a Moollah from one of the Boorjes,
evidently haranguing the people and urging them to die as Ghazees.
It has been a most unsatisfactory business altogether, and a few more
such affairs will compromise us seriously.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS.

 “The extensive village or town of Roza is situated about two miles
from Ghuznee, and is lovely to behold. When this city was taken by
the force under my command, Roza was full of inhabitants&mdash;men,
women, and children. My troops were encamped close to its walls.
Its gardens and its houses were full of property; its barns and farmyards
were well stored; its orchards were loaded with fruit; its vineyards
bent beneath a rich and ripe vintage; the property taken from
our murdered soldiers of the Ghuznee garrison were seen piled in its
dwellings.... Four days the victorious Candahar army remained
encamped close to this village, with all these temptations before it, and
at its mercy; but not a particle of anything was taken from the
Afghans. The fruit brought for sale was paid for at a rate far above
its value. No man nor living thing was injured.”&mdash;[<i>General Nott to

 The engineer officers fathomed the great well in the citadel, and
found fifty-one feet of water in it. The bottom of the well is believed
to be below the level of the river, so that it could not be drained. The
fear of a failure of water ought not, therefore, to have driven Palmer to
surrender. He might easily have secured the possession of the well by
running a covered way from it, and protecting it with his guns.</p>

 “I visited Roza in the evening, took another copy of the Cufic
inscription upon Mahmoud’s tomb, and had a long conversation with
the Moollahs of the shrine. They assert that the tomb was constructed
in its present state immediately after Mahmoud’s death; that it
remained intact during the Ghuzneevide and Ghooride dynasties, but
that when Ghenghiz Khan, in his pursuit of Jellaladeen, threatened
Ghuznee, the inhabitants heaped the tomb over with earth and ruins
to preserve it from desecration, and deserted the place. They further
pretend that the tomb thus remained buried until the time of Sultan
Abdool Rizak, the grandson or great-grandson of Timour, to whom the
spot was revealed in a vision, and who excavated and repaired the
place, and dedicated to it rich endowments of lands. The endowments
remained, they say, till the time of Nadir, when they were resumed by
the government, and since that time the establishment at the tomb has
been dependent for support upon a few gardens attached to the village,
and the voluntary offerings of devotees. The Moollahs uphold that the
gates are really those of Somnauth, and that the inscriptions on the
tomb date from the time of the son of Mahmoud; but this I hold to be
morally impossible, for although the Cufic may possibly be of the form
used in that age (which, however, I doubt), the inscription in the
Nuskh character on the reverse of the sarcophagus, which details the
precise date of the Sultan’s death, is obviously of a much later age.
From many circumstances, I feel positively certain that the tomb does
not boast a higher antiquity than that of Sultan Abdool Rizak, who
built the present walls of Ghuznee, and who is himself buried in a rude
mausoleum on the outskirts of the village of Roza. The gates, therefore,
are certainly not those of Somnauth; but it is of course the
interest of the Moollahs to keep up the delusion, and to affect for the
spot the odour both of sandal and sanctity. I was much struck by the
crowds of pilgrims, Mussulman officers in our ranks, who thronged the
tomb during my visit there to make the <i>Ziarut</i>.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s

 Major Rawlinson’s account of the removal of the gates is very
interesting. “We moved our camp,” he writes, “this morning from
the west to the east of Roza, preparatory to fairly setting out on the
march to Caubul; and during the day the measure was carried into
effect of removing the gates of Mahmoud’s tomb. The work was performed
by Europeans, and all possible delicacy was observed in not
desecrating the shrine further than was absolutely necessary. The
guardians of the tomb, when they perceived our object, retired to one
corner of the court and wept bitterly; and when the removal was
effected, they again prostrated themselves before the shrine and uttered
loud lamentations. Their only remark was: ‘You are lords of the
country, and can of course work your will on us; but why this sacrilege?
Of what value can these old timbers be to you; while to us
they are as the breath of our nostrils?’ The reply was: ‘The gates
are the property of India&mdash;taken from it by one conqueror, they are
restored to it by another. We leave the shrine undesecrated, and
merely take our own.’ The sensation is less than might have been
expected; and no doubt the Moollahs, who have had the guardianship
of the tomb for generations in their family, will be the chief sufferers
by the measure. I doubt if the Afghan tribes lately risen from
obscurity to power, and holding the country rather as conquerors than
citizens, possess that feeling of unity with each other, and identity with
the interests they are supposed to protect, to view the abduction of the
gates as a material outrage. The act may be made use of by the priesthood
to excite fanaticism against us; but if the Barukzye chiefs could
only retain their darling plaything, power, they would care little about
the gates of Somnauth. With Shah Soojah the case was different. As
the representative of the Suddozye family, aiming at the reconsolidation
of monarchical power, he could not but view the demand of Runjeet
Singh for the gates as a national indignity, powerfully affecting his own
personal and political interests. At present, religious excitement is
alone to be apprehended from our carrying off these trophies. I call
them trophies, although assured that they are spurious, for the belief
in their genuineness is, politically considered, the same as if they really
were so.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 The enemy harassed our camp at night, firing on our picquets, and
working us other annoyance. “I doubt the policy,” wrote Rawlinson,
“of our firing a few forts and going no further. It exasperates the
Afghans without intimidating them. I believe that we should either
have abstained altogether from retribution, or have carried fire and
sword before us.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 “The attack upon the heights and their subsequent abandonment,”
says Major Rawlinson, “might have led to unpleasant consequences,
had not the news of Akbar’s defeat arrived just in time to prevent
Shumshoodeen from availing himself of this advantage. We were all
most anxious to have gone straight on to Mydan, and to have attacked
Shumshoodeen in his position, throwing the light companies along the
heights to the left, which were already in our possession, the whole way
down to the Mydan gorge; but the General would not stir beyond the
place he had first marked out for his encampment, for fear of harassing
the cattle.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 <i>MS. Notes.</i>&mdash;See also the following from Rawlinson’s Journal:
“As it appeared desirable that a direct communication should be
established between the camps as soon as possible, I proposed to the
General, on arriving at Urghundeh, that I should ride in and see
General Pollock. My offer was accepted, and I immediately put on an
Afghan dress, and escorted by the Parsewans who had come out to the
camp, rode in through the town to the race-course, where I found the
Jellalabad force encamped. I experienced no sort of difficulty or inconvenience
on the road, being generally taken for an Afghan. I now
learnt from General Pollock that there were no fresh orders from Lord
Ellenborough regarding the establishment of an Afghan Government;
in fact, that he was prohibited from pledging the government to recognise
any one, but that still, as Futteh Jung had thrown himself on our
protection, and that as it was absolutely necessary something like a
government should be established, in order to enable us to obtain
supplies (the Jellalabad Commissariat being entirely exhausted) as well
as to facilitate our subsequent departure, General Pollock had resolved
to give Futteh Jung such indirect assistance as he was able. In this
view he had recommended the Kuzzilbash and Douranee chiefs to tender
their allegiance to him, and he had so far given him his countenance as
to accompany him to the Balla Hissar in the morning, and even, as the
Shah elect took his seat on the throne, to fire a royal salute, ostensibly
for the remounting of the British colours on the citadel of Caubul, but
of course, in the apprehension of the Afghans, as an honorary recognition
by us of the new monarch’s accession. I met Macgregor in my
way to the camp, coming into the Balla Hissar with all the chiefs to
make their salaam to Shah Futteh Jung as he is now called, and I now
hear that Macgregor, who conducts all the political duties of General
Pollock’s camp, endeavoured, in a private audience which he had of his
Majesty after the Durbar, to come to an explanation with him regarding
our inability to support him with men, money, or arms, and the necessity,
in consequence, of his relying entirely on his own resources. At
first sight, it appears to me out of the question that Futteh Jung should
be able to hold his own after our departure, and I see no great object
even in making the attempt, but I cannot yet form a proper judgment.”&mdash;[<i>Major

 “<i>September 14.</i>&mdash;As we find that the prisoners have certainly
been carried off to Bameean, and the Kuzzilbashes are disposed to assist
us in their recovery, while General Pollock is not likely to encounter
further opposition on his march upon Caubul, it was suggested to the
General to-day that he should despatch a brigade from Urghundeh,
where the Bameean road strikes off, to form a support for our party,
assisted by the Hazarehs, to fall back upon. He would not, however,
listen to this proposal, declaring that he had only one object in view,
that of marching his force to India <i>viâ</i> Caubul, without turning to the
right or left; and that he considered, from the tenor of all Lord Ellenborough’s
despatches, the recovery of the prisoners to be a matter of
indifference to government.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>September 15.</i>&mdash;It was again to-day urged upon the General to
send a brigade to Bameean, or in that direction, to assist in the rescue

not separate his force unless positively ordered to do so by higher
authority.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 “<i>August 28.</i>&mdash;Every hamlet and fort we passed after daybreak
poured forth its inhabitants to stare and wonder at the Feringhee
prisoners. Not an uncivil word or gesture have I ever heard or seen
in all our wanderings; but, on the contrary, many a sympathising
word and look has been expressed, and especially by people who had
previously any knowledge of us.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>August 29.</i>&mdash;On passing the above fort (of Mustapha Khan, Kuzzilbash),
where Saleh Mahomed and I were the first to arrive, I was most
agreeably surprised by the owner bringing out two or three large trays
full of excellent cakes and sweetmeats, and begging I would distribute
them among the ladies and children&mdash;expressing at the same time the
most unfeigned sympathy for all of us. To people in our unfortunate
situation, a civil word even is well appreciated, but such a mark of
kindness as this worthy Persian showed us, is not easily forgotten. His
very look bespoke him a man of generous and kindly feeling. Our
little fellow-prisoners&mdash;both boys and girls&mdash;had such a feast as they
have not had for many a day. On arriving at our bivouac, another
Kuzzilbash, who had a fort close by, hearing from Ahmed Khan that I
wanted to buy a horse, brought me one for sale. As I was, however,
afraid of running out of funds, I told him my fears. His reply was, ‘I
know you, and I will be satisfied with your note of hand. I am a
relation of Naib Sheriff Khan.’ This was a mark of confidence I could
not have expected in such dangerous times, when my life is not worth
twenty-four hours’ purchase. I did not take the animal.”&mdash;[<i>Captain

 “The commandant of our guard appears very civil and inclined to
oblige us in every possible way&mdash;at any rate he is so to me. I was
quite delighted to hear him talk in such enthusiastic terms of my
deceased and lamented friend Hopkins (his former commanding officer).
On asking him why he deserted with his company to Dost Mahomed in
September, 1840, his reply was, that he was disgusted with the
abusive language used towards him by the European non-commissioned
officers; and I do not doubt that this had a great effect in alienating
him from our service, although certainly not the immediate cause of
his desertion. Saleh Mahomed is a good-humoured, jolly fellow, and
without any prejudices against us Kaffirs. He is a soldier of fortune,
cares little whom he serves, has been to Bokhara, Yarkund, and was
at the taking of Kokund a few months ago. Rode with him the whole
march, and was much amused at his traveller’s tales. He is the
greatest hero in his own estimation I ever came across. There is no end
to his feats of valour, to which I am a ready listener, for two reasons:

<p class="pfc4">“We gentlemen, Pottinger, Johnson, Mackenzie, and Lawrence, in

shall free us from the power of Mahomed Akbar Khan, we agree to
make him (Saleh Mahomed Khan) a present of 20,000 rupees, and to
pay him monthly the sum of 1000 rupees; likewise to obtain for him
the command of a regiment in the government service; and we attest
that this agreement is not false; and should we have spoken falsely

 The agreement is thus worded:&mdash;“We, whose signatures are hereunto
attached, do bind ourselves to pay into the hands of Major
Pottinger and Captains Lawrence and Johnson, on condition of our
release being effected by an arrangement with Saleh Mahomed Khan,
such a number of months’ pay and allowances as they shall demand
from us&mdash;such pay and allowances to be rated by the scale at which we
shall find ourselves entitled to draw from the date of our release from
captivity. We, who are married, do further agree to pay the same
amount for our wives and families as for ourselves. We, whose
husbands are absent, do pledge ourselves in proportion to our husbands’
allowances.” The agreement is drawn up on half-a-sheet of foolscap
paper, in the hand-writing of Captain Johnson. The names of all the
prisoners (officers and ladies) are attached to it; the first being that of
Brigadier Shelton. There is a codicil to it, signed by Lady Macnaghten
and Mrs. Sturt, in these words:&mdash;“We, who are widows, do pledge
ourselves to pay such sums as may be demanded from us by Major
Pottinger and Captains Lawrence and Johnson in furtherance of the
above scheme”&mdash;“In our prison at Bameean: 11th September, 1842.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

 “On passing the corner of the street where I formerly lived, I
could not forego the desire of looking on the ruins of a house in which
I had passed a period of two years of happiness. Although I had
expected to see the whole place unroofed, I was not prepared for such a
scene of desolation. Not one brick was left standing on another in
either my house or that of Sir Alexander Burnes (the adjoining one).
They were nothing but a heap of dirt, covering the mouldering remains

 “<i>September 19.</i>&mdash;Our Sepoys and camp-followers, taking their
cue, I fancy, from their officers, are very unruly, and commit extensive
depredations on the lands and villages near our camp; and as the
property thus plundered chiefly belongs to the Kuzzilbash chiefs,
General Pollock, who relies mainly on these people for the consolidation
of the new government, is subject to great embarrassment. I have a
sort of misgiving that Caubul will, after all, be destroyed. In the
present state of feeling, any accidental quarrel would lead to a general
rush upon the town, and the Sepoys once there, massacre and conflagration
would assuredly follow. General Pollock, by proclamations
of encouragement, has been endeavouring to persuade the Caubullees to
return to their houses and re-open their shops; but, after all that has
happened, it is difficult to persuade the townspeople that we do not aim
at retribution, and the proceedings about our camp at Char Deh are
anything but calculated to allay their suspicions; the city continues,
therefore, more than half closed, and supplies are procurable with
difficulty.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>September 20.</i>&mdash;Our men have been plundering to-day as usual
about the camp, and in some scuffle which took place at Deh Afshur,
four of the Kuzzilbashes, with Khassim Khan, a chief, were slain by
the Sepoys.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>September 21.</i>&mdash;The fort of Mahomed Meerza, one of our worst
enemies, was given up to plunder, and we did not even respect the
property at Aliabad, which belongs to Gholam Mahomed Khan, the
lately appointed minister.... The townspeople had returned in
small numbers to the town, and had re-opened their shops; but owing
to the affair at Deh Afshur, I believe, a panic seized the people, and every
one fled, believing that orders had been issued for a general massacre.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>September 22.</i>&mdash;The depredations of the Sepoys and followers from
this camp continue, notwithstanding all the efforts that are made to
repress them. The Kuzzilbashes cannot help believing that we
encourage these excesses, and in consequence they are not half satisfied
of General Pollock’s sincerity.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

Pollock had with him? and when Mayne replied that he believed the

 A considerable body of Kuzzilbashes, under the command of Shah-zadah
Shahpoor and Khan Shereen Khan, the whole in charge of
Captain Colin Mackenzie, had accompanied M’Caskill’s force, and
co-operated with much effect, especially in rescuing a number of
sepoys and camp-followers of Elphinstone’s force from slavery. General
Pollock had appointed Captain Mackenzie to this important duty in
consequence of Lord Ellenborough’s request that he would select that
officer or John Conolly, if within his reach, for any political mission
that might be called for, even to the important duty of accompanying
General Nott’s force, if it were expedient for that officer to return by
a different route from Pollock’s. On reaching Hindostan, however,
Mackenzie met with the same neglect and injustice as the other
“children of another Government.”</p>

 “On the 9th our engineers set to work to blow up and destroy the

plunder. Both camps rushed into the city, and the consequence has
been the almost total destruction of all parts of the town, except the
Gholam-Khana quarter and the Balla Hissar.... Numbers of
people (about 4000 or 5000) had returned to Caubul, relying on our
promises of protection&mdash;rendered confident by the comparative immunity
they had enjoyed during the early part of our sojourn here, and by
the appearance, ostentatiously put forth, of an Afghan Government.
They had many of them re-opened their shops. These people have been
now reduced to utter ruin. Their goods have been plundered, and
their houses burnt over their heads. The Hindoos in particular,
whose numbers amount to some 500 families, have lost everything
they possess, and they will have to beg their way to India in rear of our
columns. The Chundarwal has had a narrow escape. Safeguards have
been placed at the different gates; but I doubt not if our parties of

 They seem to have been admitted by Pollock, but to have been
expelled by Nott. “General Pollock’s camp,” wrote Rawlinson in his
journal, “is crowded with hangers-on, imperfectly provided with
carriage or supplies, and he necessarily experiences much inconvenience
in consequence. General Nott has positively refused to permit his force
to be encumbered in the same way, and yesterday evening a general
clearance of our camp took place, preparatory to the march. About
500 men were expelled from the Bazaar of the 16th Regiment alone,
where they had taken refuge. Most of these people were the destitute
Hindoos of Caubul and Ghuznee. They had hoped to have found means
of returning to Hindostan with our column; but have been now obliged
to go back to Caubul and bide their fate among the Afghans.”&mdash;[<i>Major

Pollock took forty-four guns and a large quantity of ordnance
stores; but not the least of his trophies were a large number of
miserable mutilated natives of India, crippled by wounds or by
the frost, who had escaped with their lives from the great wreck

appointed two officers to the charge of them, and conveyed them to
Hindostan.</p>

 Major Rawlinson says: “It is whispered that the recognition of
Shahpoor on the part of the Gholam-Khana has been a mere <i>ruse</i> to
save the Balla Hissar, and that the chiefs hope to make use of this
successful manœuvre to propitiate Mahomed Akbar. The Kuzzilbash,
however, if they do meditate anything of this sort, will assuredly overreach
themselves, for if any <i>bonâ fide</i> Afghan Government succeeds in
establishing itself at Caubul, the Gholam-Khana, after what has
happened, will certainly be extirpated, root and branch.”&mdash;[<i>Major

bearing towards us in this region, yet one could not help feeling that
we had fallen from our high position; and they would have felt this
too, and in the end, perhaps, shown that they did, had not the noble
resolution been taken of moving forward to retrieve our tarnished

 “<i>October 1.</i>&mdash;The Governor-General brought me some papers to
consult me upon. Among others, a proclamation announcing that we
retire from Afghanistan, leaving to the Afghans the choice of their
sovereign. It was on this day, four years ago, that Lord Auckland
issued the proclamation announcing the grounds of his interference;
and on the same day, <i>in the same room</i>, Lord Ellenborough signed his
notification of altered intentions, in a clear, short, decided paper, which
I much approve. He could not avoid avowing some of his predecessor’s
military errors; but he has not touched at any length on the political,
further than that we lost our name and an army by neglect on the part
of our agents.”&mdash;[<i>Sir Jasper Nicholls’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 Lord Ellenborough’s explanations on this subject are to be found
in the following letter to General Pollock, which calls for no comment:</p>

<p class="pfr2">“Simlah, Oct. 12, 1842.</p>

<p class="pfc4">“<span class="smcap">General</span>,&mdash;I enclose for your information a copy of a proclamation,
signed by me here on the 1st of this month, but withheld from immediate
publication, with the view to the having previously made and
circulated to the Native Courts, and amongst the natives generally, a
correct translation which might be the official document in the native
language, and prevent any misrepresentation, or misapprehension of the
intentions of the government. I further wished not to make known
here the intention of withdrawing the army, until I knew that you had
actually the prisoners in your hands, and had made arrangements for
leaving Caubul. Your letter received here on the 5th removed every
ground for withholding the publication of the proclamation, had the
translation been prepared; but in consequence of the absence of Mr.
Clerk on duty in the plains, no such translation had been made as I
could fully rely upon.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“In the mean time, by a combination of accidents, and some
irregularity in the transaction of business in the Secretary’s office, the
printed copies of the proclamation were, without my knowledge, or
that of the Secretary himself, transmitted to the presidencies and the
political officers generally. There is no object in your publishing the
proclamation in your camp. Mr. Clerk returned last night, and the
translation will hardly be ready for transmission before to-morrow.</p>
<p class="pfn6">“I have, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="pfr2">“<span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.”</p>

 “<i>October 5.</i>&mdash;His Lordship sent me the draft of his letter to the
Hindoo chiefs, relating to the gates of the Somnauth temple; and
invited remarks on it, which I freely gave; and he took them in good
part, adopting some of them.”&mdash;[<i>Sir Jasper Nicholls’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

 The Governor-General, when he first drafted the proclamation,
only knew that Nott had reached Caubul with the gates. He may
have thought it expedient to withhold the issue of it, lest by some
untoward accident the gates might be lost on their journey through the
passes of Afghanistan.</p>

 We have no word very fitly to represent the character of the affair.
The French would have called it a <i>bêtise</i>. It was a <i>bêtise</i> of the first
magnitude.</p>

He was candid enough, too, at one time, to acknowledge that, after
the expulsion of the British from Caubul, the only chance of establishing
a settled government was through the agency of Shah Soojah. “The
Ameer concluded,” says Captain Nicolson, in the memorandum cited
above, “by using an expression exactly the same as one Shah Soojah
uses in his letter to Captain Macgregor.” He said: “The people
cannot now do without the King, for there is no one else who could carry
on the government.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

Mr. Clerk was despatched to Lahore with an invitation from the
Governor-General; and Shere Singh was inclined to accept it, but he
was overruled in Durbar. The Crown Prince, Pertab Singh, and
Dhyan Singh, the minister, were sent to represent the Maharajah at
for Governor-General’s Court.</p>

A smart skirmish between Nott’s division and the enemy, on the
Huft-Kotul, may, perhaps, be considered as an exception. Colonel
Stacy describes it as “a severe affair;” and Nott, who was not inclined
to write lengthy despatches, or to exaggerate the importance of his
engagements, thought it worthy of a brief despatch. In <i>Colonel
Stacy’s Narrative</i> and <i>Captain Neill’s Recollections of Service</i>, the
reader will find ample details of all the operations of the rear division.
<i>Lieutenant Greenwood’s Narrative</i> may also be consulted for some
particulars of the movements of M’Caskill’s division.</p>

“It was a night attack of some plunderers to obtain baggage.
There appears to have been sad confusion. The two officers were about
that time killed. But the guns were not, I believe, even attempted to be
carried off; otherwise we certainly never should have seen anything of
them again, whereas, the next day, the mountain howitzer and carriage
were found in <i>statu quo</i>, and the carriage of the three-pounder; and
were brought in. I dare say the three-pounder was not far. It in
all probability upset, and parted from the carriage; but if an enemy
(so usually termed) had made the attack, it is very improbable that
either guns or carriage would have been left, for a very few men could
carry gun, carriage, and all.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence of General
Pollock: Camp near Ali-Musjid, Nov. 1, 1842.</i>] Of this unfortunate
business, another officer writes: “Night overtook our unfortunate 3rd
Brigade. The enemy, emboldened by the darkness, came down upon
them in strength. Some of our men were <i>cut off in the column</i>.
Numbers of them were hit by stones, which were flying in all directions.
The confusion must have been great. The Irregular Cavalry
rode right over the infantry, knocking down several of the officers.
Christie and his two mountain-guns were lost sight of in the dark, and
are lost, himself killed. Young Nicholson, of the 30th, is killed. As
to the number of men killed, nothing is yet known; but the whole of
the Gholundauz that were with Christie are missing.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

Pollock, determined to give the robber tribes as little opportunity
as possible of plundering his baggage, ordered that every camel
that could not come on should be shot, and that his load, if it could
not be brought on, should be immediately burnt.</p>

One more glimpse at Afghan politics from Major Rawlinson’s
interesting journal, may be afforded before we finally close it: “A
messenger arrived to-day from Caubul with letters from the Kuzzilbash
party, inviting the Nizam-ood-Dowlah to return, as Gholam Mahomed
Khan had already given offence by endeavouring to re-establish an
exclusive Douranee influence round the puppet King. At present,
Khan Shereen is, as far as real power is concerned, paramount, and he
seems determined to carry things with a high hand, having given out
that if Shapoor lends himself to Douranee intrigue he will force him
to abdicate in favour of another Prince. A strong Kuzzilbash detachment
has at the same time been sent to Ghuznee under Mahomed
Hussein Khan, to occupy that place, and in conjunction with the
Hazarehs to hold in check any possible movement of Ghilzyes or
Douranees from the westward. Prince Hyder, with another party
of the Gholam Khana, has gone to Bameean, and expects to secure
the passes during the winter against the return of the Barukzyes.
Mahomed Akbar’s force, which remained for some time at Khanjan, is
said to have completely dispersed, the Sirdar himself, with Ameen-oollah,
having gone to Tash Noorghan, and the men having all returned
to their homes at Caubul. Newab Zemaun Khan, Jubbar Khan,
Oosman Khan, and Meer Hadjee, are said to be at Khooloom. The
people of Caubul have nearly all returned to the city, and are busy
re-opening their houses against the winter. Many of the Kohistan
chiefs, Gool Mahomed and Khoda Buksh, Ghilzyes, have also paid their
respects to Shahpoor, and Ameen-oollah was expected shortly to return.
Mahomed Akbar either really fears for his personal safety, now that
a party with which accommodation is impossible has come into power,
or he thinks it better policy to allow dissension to fructify in the
capital before he makes his reappearance on the scene. The Douranees
are in a large minority at Caubul, and must necessarily give way
before the Gholam Khana, if Khan Shereen acts with any energy.
I look to Candahar as their natural and necessary retreat, and no
doubt at that place Suddozye royalty, supported by their influence,
will continue to glimmer on, until Persia turns her attention to her
eastern frontier, and pushes forward the Barukzye Sirdars to play a
game for her. The Kuzzilbashes at the same time, cannot expect to
hold their ground at Caubul for any length of time.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s
MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

Lord Ellenborough had determined to bestow exclusive honours
upon Sale’s brigade; but Sir Jasper Nicolls desired to receive both
Pollock and Nott with the same military distinctions. “I wished,”
he wrote in his journal, “to have one of the reserve divisions to
receive each of the divisions as it came, but he (Lord Ellenborough)
did not desire that the honours paid to the garrison should be extended
to any other part of the army. This I regret, for they have all seen
hard work, great exposure, and some arduous days of service.”&mdash;[<i>Sir
Jasper Nicolls’s MS. Journal.</i>]</p>

The rejoicings, in the opinions of many, were very much marred
by the prejudiced exclusiveness of the Governor-General, who seems to
have set his face very strenuously against the political officers, no
matter what their services. With all his admiration of the illustrious
garrison, Lord Ellenborough slighted Macgregor, who was its very
life and soul; and with all his appreciation of gallantry, he seemed
unable to appreciate the services of Eldred Pottinger.</p>

I wish it to be distinctly understood, that I have neither censured
nor ridiculed the assembling of the army of reserve at Ferozepore. I
believe it to have been a very politic movement.</p>

Pollock and Nott received most deservedly the distinction of the
Grand Cross of the Bath; and Lord Ellenborough, who was created an
Earl, formally invested them at Agra, and delivered some flowery
speeches upon the occasion. It may be mentioned here that the gates
of Somnauth, which had been brought up from Ferozepore on a
triumphal car, were deposited in the magazine of Agra.</p>

In confirming the acquittal of Colonel Palmer, Sir Jasper Nicolls
wrote that “the circumstances under which Colonel Palmer surrendered
Ghuznee to the Afghans, were such as he could neither control,
alter, nor alleviate.”</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
